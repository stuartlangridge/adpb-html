			<p>A couple of times recently, my <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u300s/">Lenovo U300s Ideapad</a> has thrown hard
drive errors. The first one happened when I suspended the machine and
then left it in my bag for three days, during which the battery clearly
ran out. We leave aside that this shouldn't happen because the machine
ought to have turned that sleep into a hibernate when the battery ran
down, because I don't know whether Ubuntu supports doing that on this
hardware. I don't mind that I lost my session. However, I <em>do</em> mind that
when I started the machine up again (with power plugged in), it wouldn't
even boot. Horrible grub error.</p>
<p>That's not a good sign. I had to go and find another laptop from my
laptop graveyard, use it to download an Ubuntu ISO, find a USB stick,
create an Ubuntu USB stick with the Startup Disk Manager, boot my U300s
off the USB stick, go into the live session, mount the existing drive,
fix it, and restart. I didn't know how to do half of this stuff, and I
didn't know a bunch of things like "how do I know which format the drive
is formatted <em>in</em>"; thank you to the #ubuntu-uk IRC crew for helping me
out there. (You can read my terrible thrashing-about and their attempts
to help at
<a href="http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/11/20/%23ubuntu-uk.html#t10:48">http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/11/20/%23ubuntu-uk.html#t10:48</a>.)
Anyway, that got fixed eventually, but I was sternly informed that Disk
Failure Is A Warning Sign and I should think about replacing the drive.</p>
<p>Speed forward a few weeks, and... I discover that I can't save anything.
Looking in the system log, the drive had thrown some sort of error and
Ubuntu, rescuing me from screwing things up, had remounted the drive
read-only. So I crossed my fingers and rebooted and everything came back
up OK, and I haven't had any problems since.</p>
<p>But. Once is chance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action.
That's twice the drive has done something weird. So clearly I should
look at replacing it. New drives are not all that expensive, and that
sounds a worthwhile investment. So, I thought: it'll just be some sort
of nice standard SSD, and I'll just buy a replacement from Crucial or
something.</p>
<p>It is not. The SSD in the Lenovo U300s (note: <em>not</em> the U300, which is
different) is <a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/U300s-SSD/m-p/1147989#M90625">a non-standard SSD…similar to a bubble gum stick, like on the X1 Carbon</a>, and it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lead_org/8244608638/in/set-72157631943603923">doesn't even look like a standard SSD</a>. So,
you can't replace it with some random SSD you buy: you have to buy the
replacement from Lenovo. That's fine, thought I. Off to the Lenovo
website. Which does not mention this stuff <em>at all</em>. The Lenovo support
line don't deal with the Ideapad line in the UK; you have to ring the
special Lenovo Ideapad support line, at 13p a minute. When you ring
them, they tell you to go to <a href="http://lenovo-serviceshop.com">lenovo-serviceshop.com</a>, which just
redirects to the Medion website. What it <em>should</em> do is redirect to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131208131600/https://www.medion.com/lenovoserviceshop/welcome">medion.com/lenovoserviceshop/welcome</a>, which is where Lenovo seem to
have outsourced parts replacement to Medion. Then, once you've changed
<em>both</em> language <em>and</em> country to England rather than Germany, you can
search for your U300s's serial number and find a list of parts,
including "Various boards: Flash board, SSD 128 GB" which seems to be
the replacement. Only €46, too. It is available "on demand"... so you
have to create an account, fill in a form, get an email (in German)
saying they're looking for it, then wait two weeks, and get another
email (in German) saying "yeah, we don't have one of those".</p>
<p>Lenovo: this is appalling, dreadful customer service. I bought this
machine, your flagship Ultrabook, <em>less than two years ago</em>, I had to
run a complicated obstacle course to even find where new parts are sold
from, and once I got there I discovered that I now can't buy a fixed
drive for it. You all ought to grovel in apology for this hysterical
failure. I have no problem with you using non-standard parts — the
laptop's very thin, and that's one of the reasons I bought it, and doing
that requires compromise — but if you decide to use non-standard parts
which only you sell, it is incumbent on <strong>you</strong> to make sure they're
still on sale 24 months later! I am properly, psychotically annoyed by
this. I deliberately went for a Lenovo because they're a big company who
are not supposed to do this sort of thing. (Also see: supplying the
machine with 4GB when it is rated for...4GB. So I can't upgrade the
memory either.)</p>
<p>There will be some of you out there saying "should have bought a
Thinkpad!". Your argument there seems to be "Lenovo are such an
unreliable company that buying one of their flagship machines will lead
to you being screwed two years later… so be sure and reward them by
buying a different line." Apparently, as you'll have read above, the X1
Carbon (which is the Thinkpad I would have bought) uses a similar
"bubblegum stick"-style SSD. Perhaps the Thinkpad support line is better
and they keep parts around. But I am entirely uninspired to try.
Besides, I hate Thinkpads. Stop recommending them to me. You go ahead
and use them; I won't judge you.</p>
<p>Current mood: looking at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131208131600/https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galu1">System76 14.1" Galago UltraPro</a>, which
is ~~aluminium~~<ins>magnesium</ins>, doesn't have pointless extra mouse
buttons, has an HD screen, is thinner than their "Ultra Thin" Darter,
has HDMI and miniDP, and is just generally rather lovely. And wondering
where I'm going to find a spare grand, and whether I really need to
spend that. Is it laptop time again...?</p>
