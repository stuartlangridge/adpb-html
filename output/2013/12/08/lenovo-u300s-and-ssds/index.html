			<p>A couple of times recently, my <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u300s/">Lenovo U300s Ideapad</a> has thrown hard
drive errors. The first one happened when I suspended the machine and
then left it in my bag for three days, during which the battery clearly
ran out. We leave aside that this shouldn&#8217;t happen because the machine
ought to have turned that sleep into a hibernate when the battery ran
down, because I don&#8217;t know whether Ubuntu supports doing that on this
hardware. I don&#8217;t mind that I lost my session. However, I <em>do</em> mind that
when I started the machine up again (with power plugged in), it wouldn&#8217;t
even boot. Horrible grub&nbsp;error.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a good sign. I had to go and find another laptop from my
laptop graveyard, use it to download an Ubuntu <span class="caps">ISO</span>, find a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick,
create an Ubuntu <span class="caps">USB</span> stick with the Startup Disk Manager, boot my U300s
off the <span class="caps">USB</span> stick, go into the live session, mount the existing drive,
fix it, and restart. I didn&#8217;t know how to do half of this stuff, and I
didn&#8217;t know a bunch of things like &#8220;how do I know which format the drive
is formatted <em>in</em>&#8220;; thank you to the #ubuntu-uk <span class="caps">IRC</span> crew for helping me
out there. (You can read my terrible thrashing-about and their attempts
to help at
<a href="http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/11/20/%23ubuntu-uk.html#t10:48">http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/11/20/%23ubuntu-uk.html#t10:48</a>.)
Anyway, that got fixed eventually, but I was sternly informed that Disk
Failure Is A Warning Sign and I should think about replacing the&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>Speed forward a few weeks, and&#8230; I discover that I can&#8217;t save anything.
Looking in the system log, the drive had thrown some sort of error and
Ubuntu, rescuing me from screwing things up, had remounted the drive
read-only. So I crossed my fingers and rebooted and everything came back
up <span class="caps">OK</span>, and I haven&#8217;t had any problems&nbsp;since.</p>
<p>But. Once is chance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action.
That&#8217;s twice the drive has done something weird. So clearly I should
look at replacing it. New drives are not all that expensive, and that
sounds a worthwhile investment. So, I thought: it&#8217;ll just be some sort
of nice standard <span class="caps">SSD</span>, and I&#8217;ll just buy a replacement from Crucial or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>It is not. The <span class="caps">SSD</span> in the Lenovo U300s (note: <em>not</em> the U300, which is
different) is <a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/U300s-SSD/m-p/1147989#M90625">a non-standard <span class="caps">SSD</span>…similar to a bubble gum stick, like on the X1 Carbon</a>, and it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lead_org/8244608638/in/set-72157631943603923">doesn&#8217;t even look like a standard <span class="caps">SSD</span></a>. So,
you can&#8217;t replace it with some random <span class="caps">SSD</span> you buy: you have to buy the
replacement from Lenovo. That&#8217;s fine, thought I. Off to the Lenovo
website. Which does not mention this stuff <em>at all</em>. The Lenovo support
line don&#8217;t deal with the Ideapad line in the <span class="caps">UK</span>; you have to ring the
special Lenovo Ideapad support line, at 13p a minute. When you ring
them, they tell you to go to <a href="http://lenovo-serviceshop.com">lenovo-serviceshop.com</a>, which just
redirects to the Medion website. What it <em>should</em> do is redirect to
<a href="https://www.medion.com/lenovoserviceshop/welcome">medion.com/lenovoserviceshop/welcome</a>, which is where Lenovo seem to
have outsourced parts replacement to Medion. Then, once you&#8217;ve changed
<em>both</em> language <em>and</em> country to England rather than Germany, you can
search for your U300s&#8217;s serial number and find a list of parts,
including &#8220;Various boards: Flash board, <span class="caps">SSD</span> 128 <span class="caps">GB</span>&#8221; which seems to be
the replacement. Only €46, too. It is available &#8220;on demand&#8221;&#8230; so you
have to create an account, fill in a form, get an email (in German)
saying they&#8217;re looking for it, then wait two weeks, and get another
email (in German) saying &#8220;yeah, we don&#8217;t have one of&nbsp;those&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lenovo: this is appalling, dreadful customer service. I bought this
machine, your flagship Ultrabook, <em>less than two years ago</em>, I had to
run a complicated obstacle course to even find where new parts are sold
from, and once I got there I discovered that I now can&#8217;t buy a fixed
drive for it. You all ought to grovel in apology for this hysterical
failure. I have no problem with you using non-standard parts — the
laptop&#8217;s very thin, and that&#8217;s one of the reasons I bought it, and doing
that requires compromise — but if you decide to use non-standard parts
which only you sell, it is incumbent on <strong>you</strong> to make sure they&#8217;re
still on sale 24 months later! I am properly, psychotically annoyed by
this. I deliberately went for a Lenovo because they&#8217;re a big company who
are not supposed to do this sort of thing. (Also see: supplying the
machine with <span class="caps">4GB</span> when it is rated for&#8230;<span class="caps">4GB</span>. So I can&#8217;t upgrade the
memory&nbsp;either.)</p>
<p>There will be some of you out there saying &#8220;should have bought a
Thinkpad!&#8221;. Your argument there seems to be &#8220;Lenovo are such an
unreliable company that buying one of their flagship machines will lead
to you being screwed two years later… so be sure and reward them by
buying a different line.&#8221; Apparently, as you&#8217;ll have read above, the X1
Carbon (which is the Thinkpad I would have bought) uses a similar
&#8220;bubblegum stick&#8221;-style <span class="caps">SSD</span>. Perhaps the Thinkpad support line is better
and they keep parts around. But I am entirely uninspired to try.
Besides, I hate Thinkpads. Stop recommending them to me. You go ahead
and use them; I won&#8217;t judge&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Current mood: looking at the <a href="https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/galu1">System76 14.1&#8221; Galago UltraPro</a>, which
is ~~aluminium~~<ins>magnesium</ins>, doesn&#8217;t have pointless extra mouse
buttons, has an <span class="caps">HD</span> screen, is thinner than their &#8220;Ultra Thin&#8221; Darter,
has <span class="caps">HDMI</span> and miniDP, and is just generally rather lovely. And wondering
where I&#8217;m going to find a spare grand, and whether I really need to
spend that. Is it laptop time&nbsp;again&#8230;?</p>
