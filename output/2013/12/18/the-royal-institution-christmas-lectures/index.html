			<p>The <a href="http://www.rigb.org/">Royal Institution</a> is a scientific research society, founded a
bit over 200 years ago by Henry Cavendish and a cast of thousands. Since
1825 they’ve run a series of lectures on popular science, aimed at
children, and done around Christmas time. The first Christmas Lecture
was done by Michael Faraday, who would be in anyone’s fantasy football
All Time Scientists World <span class="caps">XI</span>. Since then they’ve done the Christmas
Lecture every year: the list of scientists who’ve given the lectures
contains stars such as Dawkins, Marcus du Sautoy, Dewar, David
Attenborough, and Carl Sagan. It’s explicitly aimed at children: the Ri
say that the lectures are designed to “introduce a young audience to a
subject through spectacular demonstrations”.</p>
<p>This year, thanks to a very kind assist from <a href="http://www.whizzy.org">Will Cooke</a>,<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-1-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-1" class="simple-footnote" title="to whom I owe a number of beers">1</a></sup> I got to take my daughter there.</p>
<p>For some people, walking out onto the centre circle at Wembley or Old
Trafford would be the culmination of a lifetime of wishes.<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-2-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-2" class="simple-footnote" title="I’d go for Anfield myself">2</a></sup> Me… I got to stand inside the Royal

<p>The building itself is (obviously) old, and has that marble-floor
wooden-counters feeling that you get from London buildings of that age.
More importantly, it’s right slap bang in the middle of Mayfair, which
is a pretty flash location and no mistake. This is what happens when you
set up a society in the eighteenth century: you get a building in the
most expensive bit of an already pretty expensive city and don’t have to
pay eye-wateringly high rent on it. Mayfair is the most expensive square
on the London Monopoly board (Americans: it’s where Boardwalk is on the
American board), but what that does mean is that the Ri’s building is
surrounded by super-high-end clothes and jewellery shops. Niamh was
pretty impressed that we could walk down one street<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-3-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-3" class="simple-footnote" title="Bond Street. Also on the Monopoly board">3</a></sup> and see the Ritz, Ralph Lauren, Chanel,
Cartier, Tiffany, Prada, and everything else she’s not getting. So we
peered in a couple of windows<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-4-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-4" class="simple-footnote" title="with brief explanation of how Mayfair embodies “if you have to ask you can’t afford it” and that’s why nothing has a price on">4</a></sup> and had lunch in the Cafe de Pierre on
Piccadilly<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-5-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-5" class="simple-footnote" title="lobster ravioli for Niamh, duck confit and pear for me. Both excellent and recommended">5</a></sup> and then headed to the Ri.</p>

<p>This lecture was, it seems, typically English in that it didn’t seem all
that smoothly organised — people were wandering about all over the
place, there was a queue, it didn’t seem very clear who to talk to or
where to go — and yet it all worked out fine, which I believe is
evidence that it actually <em>is</em> well organised without being terribly
regimental. The Ri is, being an old building, something of a maze, and
it’s full of little interesting side rooms and display cases containing
Humphrey Davy’s original miners’ safety lamp and that sort of thing.
Eventually you’re ushered into the lecture room, which is of an
interesting and quite sensible design: instead of being a stage and a
gently sloping set of seats like a cinema, it’s semicircular and pretty
narrow, with each row of seats being quite a lot higher up than the row
below. This means that if you’re on the very back top row, like I was,
you’re a fair distance up in the air but not actually that far from the
floor where the lecturer is speaking.<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-6-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-6" class="simple-footnote" title="I think it’d be jolly interesting to run a conference in a venue like this; does anywhere in Birmingham have this sort of theatre layout, I wonder?

<p>The <span class="caps">MC</span> (or warmup act, depending on how you think of it) was Matt
“<a href="https://twitter.com/standupmaths">@standupmaths</a>” Parker, one of the increasingly popular subgenre of
comedians who do science of some kind. (See also: The Infinite Monkey
Cage, Dara Ó Briain, &amp;c. I like this increasingly popular subgenre, as
if you couldn’t guess.) I’d actually come across Parker before, via the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile">Numberphile</a> videos on YouTube. He’s pretty funny. Good at keeping
everyone interested, too. What with the Lectures being aimed at
children, and televised by the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, the <span class="caps">TV</span> tail does wag the lecture dog
pretty hard. There are lots of television people running about with
cables and cameras and so on, setting things up and holding clipboards
and telling people where to stand, and Parker did a jolly good job of
distracting attention from that while pointing out that if there’s a
fire then the children in the bottom half of the lecture theatre should
leave by the exits and the adults in the top half just get to burn.</p>
<p>The actual lecture itself was by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Woollard">Dr Alison Woollard</a>, geneticist at
Oxford; there are <a href="http://www.rigb.org/christmas-lectures/2013-life-fantastic">three lectures this year, on the theme of “Life
Fantastic”</a>, and this particular one was called “Am I a mutant?”. The
content was… well, it’s biology, which is not my area of interest, and
it’s aimed at children which means that it was generally about the
structure of <span class="caps">DNA</span>, the idea of mutation, that sort of thing, all of which
I already knew, but then I’m not the target audience. Woollard is a
pretty reasonable speaker, I think, and she’d come up with some good
ways of getting the various messages across; plenty of big models of a
<span class="caps">DNA</span> double helix, paint mixing tables, and so on. I personally found the
most impressive part to be a quick demonstration she did of unhelpful
mutations. Pull eight volunteers from the audience<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-7-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-7" class="simple-footnote" title="one of whom was Niamh! yes! fame!">7</a></sup> and give them “mutations” — two were required to
stay on their knees, two wore boxing gloves, two wore blindfolds — and
then they have to “hunt for food” by trying to grab strawberry bootlace
sweets hanging down from a leafy overhead canopy. Obviously, the
“unmutated” two did best, which was a reasonably interesting
demonstration of how a “mutation” might make you worse at survival, but
Woollard then pulled a thoroughly sneaky trick. It turns out that in
addition to strawberry bootlaces hanging down from this green canopy,
there were also <em>apple</em> bootlaces, which are green. Nobody had seen
them; not the eight children, not the audience, and none had been
collected. Segue into a discussion of camouflage being a helpful
mutation. Well done, Dr Woollard.</p>
<p>There were some clunky bits with “Charles Darwin“‘s head in a projection
box which didn’t come across all that well, but any lecture involving a
box of kittens can’t be a bad thing.</p>
<p>I’m a pretty big fan of big organisations taking some time and effort
and money to make things better for children at Christmas: I love
<a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2004/12/24/norad"><span class="caps">NORAD</span>’s “Santa cam”</a> for the same reason. The Ri have been doing this
now for 188 years,<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-8-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-8" class="simple-footnote" title="and the BBC have been televising them since 1966, apart from a ten year gap from 1999 when they wrongly decided that they wouldn’t do it and so Channel 4 and More 4 did it instead; they are now back, so well done the BBC and Channel 4">8</a></sup> which is dedication to
the cause above and beyond the call of duty. They’re also pretty short
of money; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21069749">they might have to sell their Mayfair building</a> to get
enough money to keep doing science. If you’re in or near London and you
like this sort of thing, they run public lectures all the time which are
similarly priced to a cinema ticket and are considerably more
interesting,<sup id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-9-back"><a href="#sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-9" class="simple-footnote" title="and if you pick the right lecture, just as full of either explosions or spaceships">9</a></sup> and you can actually <a href="http://www.rigb.org/globals/join-support/membership">join the
Ri</a> itself for £85 and then you get in to all the public lectures for
free. As well as contributing to science, which is a good idea, yes it is.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Am I a mutant?” is on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03nc7sk"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Four at 8pm on Sunday 29th December</a>.
It’ll presumably also show up on <a href="http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures">RiChannel</a> where you can watch a
bunch of past Christmas Lecture videos. All those others won’t have
Niamh in them, though.</p><ol class="simple-footnotes"><li id="sf-the-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-1">to whom
