			<p>Christian Cantrell, in the excellent <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/c979f180243f">The Future Isn't What It Used To
Be</a>, explains why I don't yet have my jetpack by laying out a triangle
with corners at interoperability, profitability, and possibility.
Quoting,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]echnology isn’t so much about what’s possible as it is about what’s
profitable. The primary reason we haven’t landed a human on Mars yet
has less to do with the technical challenges of the undertaking, and
far more to do with the costs associated with solving them. And the
only reason the entire sum of human knowledge and scientific,
artistic, and cultural endeavor isn’t instantly available at every
single person’s fingertips anywhere on the planet isn’t because we
can’t figure out how to do it — it’s because we haven’t yet figured
out the business models to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is entirely right. We don't have supersonic flight from everywhere
to everywhere. A century ago the idea of being able to fly faster than
the speed of sound was close to laughable; those that did speculate
about it envisioned me being able to fly at Mach 2 from my house to the
shops. It hasn't happened, but not because of physics; it hasn't
happened because no-one can work out how to do it without it being a
money sink. Put another way, if space aliens wanted to summarise the
history of humanity in one sentence, a reasonable contender for that
sentence would be this: you get what you pay for. And no-one wants to
pay for supersonic flight from London to New York, let alone from here
to the supermarket.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where you can't really <em>blame</em> anyone; it's
just the way the universe works out, irritatingly.</p>
<p>But. (You, gentle reader, could see that that was coming.) Not
everything is supersonic flight. Cantrell again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider something relatively straightforward like a multi-touch
interface on your closet door that allows you to easily browse and
experiment with your wardrobe, offering suggestions based on prior
behavior, your upcoming schedule, and the weather in the locations
where you are expected throughout the day... There’s very little about
[this] that isn’t entirely possible right now using technology that
either already exists, or that could be developed relatively easily.
So if the future is possible today, why is it still the future?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and then goes on to explain that, like supersonic flight, this stuff
doesn't happen because it's hard to imagine making it profitable. And
this is true. If some sort of serious company were to dedicate
themselves to making the iDoor, to put together a big marketing budget,
to convince people that they need it, to take the time to demonstrate
why your life would be better with this thing, to put it in shops where
you can buy it, to build the cloud services that it depends on… then,
yes, they'd <em>probably</em> sell a million of 'em and make a huge profit and
create a whole new market for smart domestic appliances. Of course,
perhaps that company would sink millions into doing it and then vanish
without trace, like Fun Boy Three or something. And in order to sink
millions into a project to begin with, you have to <em>have</em> millions.
Which is not particularly a given.</p>
<p>However… half the people reading this are techies. And those techies are
thinking: hey, sure, I could have one of those if I wanted. Buy a forty
quid crappy Android tablet, throw together a web app and put it on a
server, point the tablet at the web app, and superglue it to my wardrobe
door, and Bob's your mother's brother, ta daaah.</p>
<p>So it <em>is</em> doable. And profitably, too, assuming that you can throw
together the app in a weekend and that having the iDoor at all is worth
more to you than forty quid and a weekend of spare time. So there's
something a little bit wrong with Cantrell's thesis, surely?</p>
<p>Well. Not necessarily. Clearly the major issue there is that it assumes
that you're capable of writing a bunch of software. Typical hacker thing
to think. Most people can't do that, don't want to do that, aren't
interested in doing that. And this is true, for the same reason that I'm
not interested in learning how my car works; if it goes wrong, I'll take
it to a garage and pay money to fix it. I exchange money for time, which
is what money is for. Great, except that, as we discovered above, there
is no market out there in iDoors for me to throw money <em>at</em>. It has been
said that the second iPod cost £350 to build but the first cost four
hundred million dollars. The iPod is a mass-market product. And what
we're describing here is a different sort of a thing. If you think about
it, there are two types of products:</p>
<h4>Mass market products</h4>
<p>You make money through economies of scale. The first one costs \$400
million, the others cost £350, you sell them for £500, and eventually
pay off your initial investment, and everything after that is profit.
Hooray! This is, in essence, how every business plan ever works. It's
successful if the thing you make really <em>is</em> what everyone wants; that
most people's desires are roughly the same, or at least are
caterable-for by the customisability built into the device.</p>
<h4>Hand-crafted individual products</h4>
<p>A thing made for one person only, deliberately constructed to their
desires, and with no interest in making it useful to others. Requires
skill to make; is likely not expensive.</p>
<p>Hand-crafted isn't really the word here. This is not about lovingly
whittled bird-houses or carefully sewn samplers. When you make a product
for yourself, you don't put the fit and finish on it, most of the time.
If you need to reach something high up, you don't carefully design and
construct a stepladder; you put a stool on top of a chair and then stand
on the tower of furniture. That's what "hand-crafting" is, most of the
time: a jury-rigged thing. You've built a product, there; one with a
temporary lifetime, but it <em>does what you need it to do</em>, and you were
able to construct it for yourself, without help, without purchase.</p>
<p>And that's why home-built software is, most of the time, not a good
advert for itself: most of the people capable of throwing together the
iDoor would make it unpretty, because that's quicker to do. More
importantly, if you make your homemade iDoor look and feel wonderful <em>to
other people</em>, then you're <em>not building a hand-crafted one-person tool</em>
any more, are you? You're trying to build a mass-market tool, because
you're trying to impress people who are not you. There is almost no
space in the zeitgeist to help people build a thing for themselves and
have that be good, because everything's keyed around recognition, around
knowing that a thing was a good idea because other people say "I want an
iDoor!" and then suddenly you're the CEO of iDoor.com even though it was
just a fun weekend project.</p>
<p>And this is made a lot more difficult by the culture of mockery around
empowering people to do this for themselves. It's hard to get off the
ground with a project designed to help people help themselves, exactly
because it's too easy for others to sneer and say "I want my problems
solved for me, and so does everyone else; why would anyone want to
learn?". And on the other side of the fence you've got Make magazine,
radio hams, open source people, kit car builders, most of whom are more
interested in having raging internal wars inside their own communities
about when to use a three-eights Gripley, or are more interested in just
staying inside that community and not trying to convince everyone else
because of the barrage of mockery.</p>
<p>And what this means is that making an iDoor is a lot harder than it
should be, because there is little to nothing to help me do it. Apps
that help me build apps are all keyed around the idea that I'll make an
application and then sell it, not that I'll make an application and
no-one other than me will ever see it. Everything that talks about
making software is oriented around making it so that other people like
it: whether you should do that so they'll buy it, or for ideological
purity because it's good to give away, there is little around helping
people make a thing which is useful to them and them alone.</p>
<p>Cantrell is currently entirely correct: what blocks things from becoming
products is financial viability, not scientific possibility. And what
stops the future being now is that we can't buy the products. So how do
we change the mindset so that I can help myself rather than wait for
someone else to solve it for me and my million friends? How do I build a
product with a demographic of one?</p>
