			<p>Birmimgham is a great big city with a bunch of tech stuff going on. But
it's hard to work out, if you live here, all the stuff that's happening,
techwise. I miss out on events all the time. Let's talk about fixing
that.</p>
<p>If you don't live in or near Birmingham, this will likely not be of
interest to you. In fact, if you're not interested in the Brum tech
scene, please don't weigh into this discussion: I don't want theoretical
stuff.</p>
<p>OK. So, there are loads of tech things going on in Birmingham. And there
are loads of people who have thought "hey, I should set up some sort of
'this is all the tech events in Birmingham' calendar". So we now have
<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=Z2syZzdlbjFsc2tnbmRna2tuaXJqOTdjOThjNWIzbGdAaW1wb3J0LmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20">Stuart Bates's calendar</a>, <a href="http://siliconcanal.co.uk/events/">Silicon Canal</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=techevent@gmail.com">Birmingham
TechEvents</a>, <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/genres/digital">LiveBrum</a>, <a href="http://events.birmingham.gov.uk/">the Council</a>, <a href="http://startupdigest.com/birmingham/">Birmingham Startup
Digest</a>, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/guides/birmingham-geeks/">Lanyrd's Birmingham Geeks</a>, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/places/birmingham/">Lanyrd's Birmimgham
listing</a>, <a href="http://varchar.co.uk/birmingham/events.htm">Gav's list</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cities/gb/43/birmingham/">Meetup's listing for Birmingham</a>… this is
stupid.</p>
<p>The thing we need is two-fold. The first part (and this is the easy
part) is for there to be One Calendar That Lists Everything. The best
example of this is<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=Z2syZzdlbjFsc2tnbmRna2tuaXJqOTdjOThjNWIzbGdAaW1wb3J0LmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20">Stuart Bates's personal calendar</a>, but this
could be anything; it could happily be something which aggregated a
bunch of other feeds, like Startup Digest and Lanyrd and Meetup and Brum
Techevents.</p>
<p>The second part: that's the thing. We need one place <em>that everyone else
recommends</em>.</p>
<p>To explain this, I need to talk about user stories.</p>
<p>In my head, there are three different type of "consumers" for this
what's-on-in-Birmingham thing.</p>
<p>The first is someone who lives in Brum and cares about tech stuff. So,
sitting there one evening and she thinks "hey, I wonder what's going on
this evening", or she looks at the calendar and plans her evenings
around it; seeing that there's a NoSQL thing this evening or a Linux
User Goup on Thursday next week; she pays attention to the calendar and
everything on it.</p>
<p>The second type of person is someone who learns about the Birmingham
tech scene through one meeting. So. she's a Wordpress fan; she's
interested in hanging with Wordpress people; she goes to a few
<a href="http://www.wpbham.co.uk/">WordPress Birmingham</a> evening events. Because she's now hanging with
the Brum tech scene, she discovers that <a href="brumgirlgeeks.co.uk/‎">Brumgirlgeeks</a> exists, or
that <a href="http://siliconcanal.co.uk/silicon-canal-beers-2/">Silicon Canal</a> exists… and now she's going to loads of other
things, because now she's tapped into a calendar which <em>lists</em> all those
other things.</p>
<p>The third type of person is not a Brum person; they're in town for a day
or two only, stuck in some corporate hotel, and they think, "hey, this
is a big city, I bet there's some sort of tech thing going on this
evening that'd be interesting to me". So they go and Google for that and
discover the List Of Everything Tech In Birmingham and see that <a href="http://www.agilestaffordshire.org/">Agile
Staffs</a> is on this evening, and so he shows up at Agile Staffs for one
evening.</p>
<p>So, you've got these three types of people, and we've got a whole bunch
of calendars, all of which want to be The One True Calendar For
Birmingham Tech Things, and none of which are.</p>
<p>Building another calendar -- one which aggregates all the others,
perhaps -- isn't hard. And if you're reading this, you're probably
thinking in terms of the technology; how to build an aggregating
calendar. But that's not the thing.</p>
<p>Imagine that there's One True Calendar and everyone agrees to put their
events in it -- not directly necessarily, but via Meetup or Lanyrd or
manual effort or Startup Digest or whatever. Now, think of our Wordpress
fan. How does she discover that the One True Calendar even <em>exists</em>?
Well… because the Wordpress Birmingham site says "we're part of
Birmingham's One True Calendar", that's how. That's how this should
happen. Everyone agrees that some calendar is the central source for
information, and then everyone <em>publicises that calendar</em>. Not their own
calendar. That one. Obviously, the people who run Silicon Canal will say
"the One True Calendar should be ours". As will the people who run Brum
TechEvents, and the people who run LiveBrum, and everyone else. It
doesn't really matter <em>where</em> the One True Calendar is: what matters is
that everyone who runs a tech event in Brum is in it… because everyone
who cares about tech events in Brum wants to see a Birmingham tech scene
evolve. It's about being part of something larger. Yes, that involves
some humility; it'll involve some people who believe that they run the
One True Calendar already taking a step back and saying "I'll let
someone else do this". But it's all for Birmingham. It's all for our
tech scene. And everyone ends up better because of it.</p>
<p>So what I'd like to see is a badge: "We're part of BrumTechScene", or
whatever the central aggregating thing ends up being called. And then
event organisers agree that they <em>are</em> part of it, and talk about it.
Put the badge on their event websites. When someone says "hey, what's
going on in Brum", the answer is "look at BrumTechScene.com", or
wherever the calendar ends up living. It's the place that everyone
agrees on.</p>
<p>So, we have fifty people who could do the technology. What I'd like to
see is event organisers getting together and agreeing. Being prepared to
take one for the team; to all agree on somewhere to talk about this.
Because making it more obvious that Birmingham has a vibrant tech scene
already is better for all of us, right? So, event organisers, start
talking. Start showing that you want to see Birmingham be a great city
for technology more than you want to be the emperor of it all. We're all
in this together. Let's make it great. Talk about how you want to push
Birmingham as a tech city… or about your objections to this plan, about
how you think that your event shouldn't be part of it, so that can be
fixed.</p>
<p>Now's your chance to stand up and be counted: are you in?</p>
