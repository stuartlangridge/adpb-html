		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Bruce Lawson <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/more-on-drm-in-html5/">started a very interesting discussion about the Encrypted
Media Extensions to HTML</a> a few months ago, with learned and
interesting commentary from John Foliot and others. After devoting some
thought to this, I believe that the amount of argument around this
subject is at least partially caused by its separation of the web from
the spirit of the web.</p>
<p>A few things to dismiss first. This is about DRM. John's technically
right that that's not all that EME is about, but that's frankly
disingenuous. DRM is most of what EME is about, it's all of what
objectors object to, and pointing at the other reasons is like walking
into St. Thomas's Hospital and saying that smoking reduces the risk of
Alzheimer's. It does...but you are missing the point.</p>
<p>Secondly, this discussion is not about whether DRM is a good idea at
all. Certainly many people have an opinion on that. It is also
reasonable, if you dislike DRM, to believe that EME is a bad idea
because it further legitimises DRM, and to make an argument in those
terms. But if you fundamentally disagree with DRM then your argument is
better directed either at movie studios (to stop them producing movies
with it) or at ordinary purchasers (to convince them that avoiding DRM
is more important than watching movies). I do not believe that anyone
rationally discussing EME is acting in genuine bad faith - there is no
big conspiracy here. From what I've seen, this is a discussion of
pragmatism: given that DRM exists and movies use it and people want
movies, is it a good idea to integrate DRM movie playback more tightly
with the web? I do not propose that anyone's sacred right to be heard is
compromised: what I suggest is that arguments are best directed against
those most able to fix it. If you hate DRM, send your ire against
Paramount or your neighbours, not your web browser.</p>
<p>OK, those distractions aside, the point I was making is this: one of the
really nice things about the web is that it is set up to be open, and in
order to participate, you have to be too. Stuff on the web is available
to accessibility technologies; you can read the code that makes up a
page; it's available on many devices including ones you've never heard
of; it's backwards compatible right down to text browsers. Of course
it's possible to build stuff on the web which fails to meet these
things, but in general, participation in the web means that you're
automatically building something that meets those goals, because that's
built in to the whole concept. There is a reason that the web took off
rather than Hypercard or FoxPro. So, historically, "let's get this new
technology onto the web" meant, at least partially, that that new
technology would need to become accessible and available to everyone on
every operating system and every device and open. So adding a new
technology to the web was a good thing for people who wanted to use that
technology in places that weren't anticipated by the tech owners. The
web enables everybody; therefore, everybody's in favour of things being
on the web. QED.</p>
<p>The Encrypted Media Extensions are not like that. They are explicitly
designed to provide a framework to plug in other technologies, with no
guarantee whatsoever that those other technologies are actually
available. What this actually means, in practice, is that Microsoft will
build a shim layer between EME and the PlayReady DRM parts of
Silverlight, and then we'll be in exactly the situation we are in now:
if you have Silverlight now, you'll be able to use EME then. If you
don't, you won't. All that's happened is that DRM plugins have now been
blessed as being "part of the web" -- PlayReady can now claim to be
"HTML5" rather than a plugin. Hooray. What have we gained?</p>
<p>Well, there are some benefits. Given that DRMed video will be available
through HTML's <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element (I assume), we'll be able to, say, put
that video on the side of a 3D CSS rotating cube, and other similar
effects. Obviously not all video manipulation will be possible; at the
moment it's quite easy to digitally manipulate a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> through a
<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, and that'll have to be stopped if you're trying to
manipulate a DRMed video. It's nice that DRMed video will at least
partially be part of the HTML world rather than siloed off in a little
plugin window.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that that justifies the work. Adding EME to HTML
will mean that everyone who can already watch Harry Potter movies can
continue to watch them. It will not extend this any further; it will not
widen the viewing audience; it will not decentralise the control; and it
will divide the web further into the haves and the have-nots. One of the
big reasons that the web is a good idea is that it stops there <em>being</em>
any have-nots. EME bringing DRM to <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> will stomp all over that.
There is no difference, none, between a a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag which requires a
platform-specific plugin to work and an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag which plays a
video and requires a platform-specific plugin to work. The argument has
been made that if the web doesn't embrace this stuff, people won't stop
watching videos: they'll just go somewhere other than the web to get
them, and that is a correct argument. But what is the <em>point</em> in
bringing people to the web to watch their videos, if in order to do so
the web becomes platform-specific and unopen and balkanised? The goal
wasn't "get everyone on the web", it was "bring knowledge and
entertainment and everything to everyone", and the web was the best way
to do that. If getting the "everything" means giving up on the
"everyone", we're doing it wrong.</p>
