			<p>Last week I got the opportunity to play with Google Glass, thanks to
<a href="https://twitter.com/davegullo">Dave Gullo</a>. It was... interesting.</p>
<p>Firstly, the technology of letting you see things is well worked out.
The "screen" is there in your eye if you look at it, but if you don't
look at it then it doesn't impede your vision at all; it's peripheral.
Those of you who wear glasses will know what I'm talking about here: if
you look, you can see the frames of your glasses, but they don't block
your sight or even get noticed unless you're specifically looking for
them. The Glass "screen" exists in this same location in your eyes,
which is a neat trick. It's also clear and easily readable.</p>
<p>Controlling it... is less obvious. The thickened "arm" of the glasses,
which runs along your temple, also hosts the controls for it; you swipe
along it in one direction or the other to scroll through the UI. The
UI's based on "cards": individual screens which can be moved back and
forth, like slides in a presentation. I can see this sort of technology
being useful for someone with information that needs scrolling through
in this manner: your notes for a presentation, medical personnel,
someone looking through the manual for the aircraft they're working on,
that sort of thing. That is: it's an output device. No problem with
that. Glance and see your email, incoming messages, the turn-by-turn
navigation of your current journey. You can flip through cards until you
hit the one for your mailbox, swipe down to select it, swipe across to
scroll through individual emails, swipe down to read one of them. It's
surprising how much stuff you can get at with just "previous", "next",
and "select" gestures. This is a similar problem to that being solved by
media centres and so on, where you want to look through all of your
films and TV and music with only left, right, and enter buttons, and
it's solved a similar way.</p>
<p>The two obvious big problems with Glass are input and that you look like
a tool while wearing it. The latter is relatively easy to solve: Glass
is clearly a prototype, a way to get this sort of tech out into the
world. It'll get smaller, less obtrusive, be built into spectacles for
those who wear them, and so on. I'm not worried about that. Input,
however, is more of a problem. Swiping between different cards is a
simple degenerate form of "input": you scroll through various pre-set
screens, and that's OK. If you want to do anything more complex, like a
search, or to pull up information that you haven't previously
pre-programmed into it, you have more of a problem. There is, of course,
voice control. Leaving aside for the moment that voice control is
notoriously unreliable, and that it's even more unreliable if you don't
have a Bay Area accent, voice is audible to others. This is fine if
you're sitting in the car saying "Google, navigate to the nearest
Buffalo Wild Wings", or sitting in your living room saying "Siri, remind
me tomorrow at 9am to ring Kevin Spacey about starring in my film", but
it's way, way more of a problem if you're on the tube and say "OK Glass,
search for 'the autobiography of Adolf Hitler'" because you need to
study it for a history project. There are people who talk to themselves
on the train, but they're all insane. This is not a thing to be
emulated. Of course, fifteen years ago the idea of walking along the
street staring at a little screen looked mildly insane and the world has
adapted so that that's the norm, but I'm not at all sure that I <em>want</em>
the world to adapt so people speaking to their personal electronics in
public is a standard thing to happen. "Computer, what is the nature of
the universe?" is all well and good when Bev Crusher says it, but I'd
rather that we worked on replicators.</p>
<p>Input for wearable computing is, in general, a problem. Those of you who
have known me for a while will likely have heard my theory about <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/birmingham-hack-space/sEXiX40njzQ/uDquYlwYMzMJ">using
two mostly-invisible wristbands as a chording keyboard</a>, but that's
not really mass-market. The normal approach of using sci-fi writings as
a guide here doesn't help much: people don't seem to communicate
privately with their computers in public in the future, unless by stuff
that isn't real, like telepathy or "sub-vocalising". Waving your arms in
the air <em>a la</em> <em>Minority Report</em> might look cool on film but is not at
all practical when you're in Debenhams. This is, in my mind, the biggest
thing opposing wearables right now, and I'm sure it's being worked on:
what's out there that looks a plausible method to input arbitrary
requests to a wearable computer while in public? What's state of the
art?</p>
<p>Google Glass is currently probably the state of the art, and it has
problems. I faintly hoped that I'd see hundreds of people walking around
in San Francisco wearing them, and it was not so. But you can see how
it's a big step forward. Glass is an actual implementation rather than
speculation. It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benz_Patent-Motorwagen">Benz Patent-Motorwagen</a> in an industry which
will eventually give us the Lamborghini Aventador (and the Toyota
Corolla, so everyone owns one). I look forward to seeing what comes
next.</p>
