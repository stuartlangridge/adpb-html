		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>My first app for Ubuntu phones is in the Ubuntu phone app&nbsp;store!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/riddling">Riddling</a>&#8220;, and it&#8217;s a puzzle game involving
intelligence, psychology, lateral thinking, research, and&nbsp;guesswork.</p>
<p>If you have an Ubuntu phone, you can get it right now: just search for
&#8220;Riddling&#8221; in the Applications scope and install it. Let me know what
you&nbsp;think.</p>
<p><a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/device-2013-10-28-200608.png"><img alt="The main Riddling screen, level 3" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/device-2013-10-28-200608-180x300.png" /></a></p>
<h2>Behind the&nbsp;scenes</h2>
<p>If you just want to play the game, the rest of this post will not be of
interest to you. I wrote Riddling partially because I think it&#8217;s a good
idea for a game, but also to get some more detailed experience of the
whole process of creating a completed application for Ubuntu phones:
everything from the app review process to all the work you need to do
outside core gameplay to make a decent app, and including the tools for
building and checking applications, how to test them on the phone, and
so on. So below I&#8217;ll outline some thoughts on this whole process. The
basic summary is that building apps for Ubuntu is great and you should
do it. There are still a few rough edges in the whole process, and so
I&#8217;m writing them down in the hope that it&#8217;s useful feedback. Your
thoughts, links to Launchpad bugs, disagreements, improvements, and war
stories are&nbsp;invited.</p>
<h3>App&nbsp;Creation</h3>
<p>Apps for Ubuntu are created with <span class="caps">QML</span>. I personally, to make my biases
clear, think it ought to be possible to develop almost any app using
pure <span class="caps">QML</span> and JavaScript without any C++ involved. I don&#8217;t want to have
to compile things, to think about different architectures, to ship more
than one binary, to have to <em>care</em> about any of that stuff at all. You
may feel differently, and you are welcome to do so, but be aware of my
biases here: if your proposal for fixing issues that I bring up is
&#8220;write C++&#8221;, &#8220;everyone should be compiling their apps from C++ anyway&#8221;,
or something similar, then I&#8217;m going to disagree on those&nbsp;grounds.</p>
<p>On with the&nbsp;show.</p>
<p><a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/device-2013-10-28-201308.png"><img alt="Riddling's About screen" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/device-2013-10-28-201308-180x300.png" /></a></p>
<h4><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221;</h4>
<p>One creates an Ubuntu app with the Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>. That makes sense: an <span class="caps">SDK</span>
is a collection of APIs which your app can use. For Ubuntu, though,
&#8220;Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221; is also the name of the <span class="caps">IDE</span>, the development environment:
to make an app, you open the Dash and search for &#8220;Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221; and then
run it. That makes a certain amount of sense, but it makes this really
hard to talk about: questions such as &#8220;how do I run my app in Ubuntu
<span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221; sound strange, because it&#8217;s entirely unclear whether you&#8217;re talking
about the APIs or the <span class="caps">IDE</span>. This is why developer environments have
names: Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse. I wish the &#8220;Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221; was called
an actual&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But it&#8217;s got a name!&#8221;, some of you will be saying. &#8220;It is Qt Creator.&#8221;
Ah, but it isn&#8217;t. It is Qt Creator <em>with extra stuff</em>. I can&#8217;t just say
to people &#8220;to make an Ubuntu app, run Qt Creator&#8221; because they won&#8217;t
have the extra stuff. &#8220;To make an Ubuntu app, run Qt Creator and then
install this other thing and this other thing and configure this thing
and this other thing&#8230;&#8221; is the way to having people say, that sounds
really hard so I&#8217;m not going to do that. This is why I wish that &#8220;Ubuntu
<span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221; was called something. Branding is important. The Ubuntu app
development experience is <em>not</em> just &#8220;Qt Creator with an Ubuntu plugin&#8221;,
or at least it can&#8217;t be if it&#8217;s going to be&nbsp;successful.</p>
<h4>Custom build&nbsp;steps</h4>
<p>Riddling is basically a game where you have to type in an answer for
each level to proceed to the next level. Ubuntu users being what they
are, a reasonable proportion of them will think, I can&#8217;t work out the
answer for level 11, so I&#8217;ll just look in the source and get the answer
from there. This would, obviously, spoil the game somewhat &#8212; the
challenge is to research and think laterally, not to be a developer who
knows what source code is &#8212; and so the game does not directly contain
the answers; the game contains <em>hashes</em> of the answers and your entered
answer is compared against that, in a similar way to how web services
and Ubuntu itself check that your login password is correct without ever
having a plain-text copy of that password around to check against. This
is all well and good, but obviously I can&#8217;t be writing hashes all the
time by hand. So my copy of the game contains the real plain-text
answers, and when I build the game I take those plain-text answers and
create the hashes of them to store in the released version. What this
requires is a <em>custom build step</em> &#8212; a way to add an extra step to the
build process as run by &#8220;Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221;, so I can add a step which does
this answer&nbsp;encryption.</p>
<p>It is not possible to add a custom build step to the build process for
Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span> apps, at the moment. What this means in practice is that I
have to write my own build process. I have a little shell script which
does all the things I need: does the answer encryption, creates icon
images from my original <span class="caps">SVG</span> icon, builds a click package. And I run that
shell script <em>instead</em> of using the Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span> thing. That&#8217;s quite
annoying: it means that I&#8217;ve stepped almost entirely outside the Ubuntu
<span class="caps">SDK</span> <span class="caps">IDE</span> at that point. (And indeed I&#8217;ve found myself doing most of my
editing in my normal editor, Sublime Text.) To be clear, it is a credit
to the Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span> team that it&#8217;s perfectly possible to make Ubuntu apps
without being forced to use the Ubuntu team&#8217;s choice of <span class="caps">IDE</span>. But I
<em>want</em> to use their <span class="caps">IDE</span> &#8212; it&#8217;s all nicely integrated, it provides a
whole bunch of stuff like device connection and code completion and
debugging that others don&#8217;t &#8212; but I can&#8217;t because of this one blocker
about custom build steps. All I&#8217;d need is some way to add a step which
runs an arbitrary command: with that, I&#8217;d be golden. I spoke to some Qt
Creator experts and it isn&#8217;t doable at the moment, but apparently it
might be: this is exacerbated by how Qt Creator documentation basically
assumes that you&#8217;re a C++ person and therefore &#8220;I want a custom build
step&#8221; is &#8220;add something to your cmake file&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t even exist if
you&#8217;re writing a pure <span class="caps">QML</span> app as I think apps should be (and this one
certainly should be, even if others shouldn&#8217;t). This feeling that &#8220;well,
you&#8217;ll be writing C++ anyway, or you&#8217;re not a real programmer&#8221; does seem
to rather pervade the community; it&#8217;s something that I hope Ubuntu can
help&nbsp;fix.</p>
<h4>Lint</h4>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Linting&#8221; is the process of checking some code for accuracy and
completeness. In this example, it&#8217;s about checking your built click
package to confirm that it&#8217;s correct. <a href="http://popey.com/">Alan Pope</a> pointed me in the
direction of the excellent <a href="https://launchpad.net/click-reviewers-tools">click reviewers tools</a>: once I&#8217;ve built my
click package, I do
<code>click-reviewers-tools/bin/click-run-checks com.ubuntu.developer.whoever_1.0_all.click</code>
and it gives me a bunch of information about the package and catches a
bunch of errors. It&#8217;s incredibly handy: I was, for example, providing a
full path to the <code>qmlscene</code> binary, and that works fine on my computer
and also when running my app by hand on the phone, but it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> work
when running the app on the phone from the Dash. The
click-reviewers-tools caught that error and I fixed it. That&#8217;s great.
These tools need more publicity. I understand that they&#8217;re supposed to
be integrated into the <span class="caps">IDE</span> build process at some point, which will be
excellent (although it wouldn&#8217;t have helped me because of my custom
build script, as&nbsp;above).</p>

<h4>Documentation of <span class="caps">QML</span></h4>
<p><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/modules-qml.html"><span class="caps">QML</span> is quite well documented</a> by the Qt project. The <a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-1.0/">Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>
components are mediumly-well documented</a> by the Ubuntu team, and that
documentation improves and gets more detailed every day, so I&#8217;m not
worried about that. What is both confusing and annoying is that those
two bits of documentation are in different places and are unconnected.
For example, <a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-1.0/Ubuntu.Components.Label/">the documentation for an Ubuntu.Components.Label</a>
shows that the only thing you can customise about a Label is its
fontSize. The example then sets <code>text</code> on it. What&#8217;s <code>text</code>? That&#8217;s
undocumented? And how do I set the colour of the text? What about rich
formatted&nbsp;text?</p>
<p>Well, an <code>Ubuntu.Components.Label</code> is <em>actually</em> an augmented <span class="caps">QML</span>
<a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qml-qtquick2-text.html">Text</a> item. The <span class="caps">QML</span> documentation for <code>Text</code> shows a zillion other
properties that are settable, and to make any use of a <code>Label</code> at all
you need to know that it&#8217;s really a <code>Text</code> but with extra stuff. The
<code>Label</code> documentation doesn&#8217;t help with this at all. I only know that a
<code>Label</code> is really a <code>Text</code> because I asked someone and looked in the
source for the Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span> itself. And if I look at the <code>Text</code> docs they
say I can set <code>font.pixelSize</code>&#8230; but if I&#8217;m really a <code>Label</code> then I&#8217;m
not supposed to do that; I&#8217;m supposed to set <code>fontSize</code> to one of the
chosen Ubuntu sizes, for consistency across the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>The documentation being split like this makes it way harder to work out
what to do. I think my proposed solution is that the Ubuntu
documentation site ought to include the <span class="caps">QML</span> documentation too, so a
<code>Label</code> lists all its properties, not just the ones that differ from
<code>Text</code>, and explains why you should use <code>fontSize</code> rather than
<code>font.pixelSize</code>.</p>
<p>This is a fairly mammoth undertaking, and I&#8217;m sure that the Ubuntu
documentation team are aware of it and are working on it. For the moment
it&#8217;s doable &#8212; as I say, I have successfully written an app &#8212; but I
think it will confuse new app developers who are unaware that the Ubuntu
<span class="caps">SDK</span> documentation only tells half the story, and the Qt <span class="caps">QML</span>
documentation isn&#8217;t necessarily the best way to build Ubuntu&nbsp;apps.</p>
<h3>Making a decent&nbsp;app</h3>
<p>Part of the goal in writing Riddling was to really nail down the
difference between &#8220;core gameplay&#8221; and &#8220;a finished app&#8221;. Riddling is
ridiculously simple in concept: as mentioned, it&#8217;s just &#8220;allow the user
to type in an answer and then check it against the list of answers&#8221;. I
had the basics of the game implemented in, not kidding, 15 minutes.
Everything else I did is bridging the gap between &#8220;prove the basic
principle&#8221; and &#8220;make a game that people want to play&#8221;. All this bridging
stuff is <em>critical</em>; it&#8217;s what makes the difference between a good idea
and a good app. The idea (and the implementation of the idea) is about
5% of what makes an app good. Many open source apps haven&#8217;t quite
grasped this and are just a bare implementation of the idea without the
other 95% which takes it from idea to app. The Ubuntu philosophy is to
do the other 95% too (whether that&#8217;s always succeeded is a different
question, of course). So, for reference, here&#8217;s the list of other stuff
I had to do to make Riddling once I&#8217;d made the core game in 15&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>Work out how to encrypt the answers and encrypt them; add the &#8220;universal
answer&#8221; which is accepted for every question so that I can test the
game; choose a background gradient; choose font sizes; adjust the
spacing between the clue, the text box, and the submission button on the
front screen; work out how to convey the current level number; make the
text box accept Enter to submit as well as pressing the button; add the
list of previous answers; add an about page; have the app remember your
current position when it&#8217;s closed and restarted; add a way to reset the
game so you can hand the phone to your kids and they can play; add
subtle sound effects for correct and incorrect answers; credit the
freesound creators of those sound effects; add an animation transition
to show a correct or incorrect answer; decide on the proper easing for
those animations; write a one-line description of the game; write a
longer description of the game; design an icon; make icons in various
different sizes; decide on a licence; make a website of the game; take
screenshots of the game; test the game on a phone; test the game on a
desktop; decide how big the window should be on a desktop; upload new
versions of the click package to the website; work out how to tell
people about the app; post to G+, to reddit, to&nbsp;twitter.</p>
<p>None of that is to applaud myself for work; it&#8217;s to illustrate how much
stuff still remains to be done once you&#8217;ve come up with an idea and then
built a rough implementation of that idea. None of it is specific to
building Ubuntu apps, either. I personally am enormously guilty of
having an idea, knocking out a rough implementation of that idea, and
then thinking to myself &#8220;cool, that works; turning that into an actual
game is just a small matter of programming and is quite boring, so maybe
I&#8217;ll just release this as it is&#8221;. That&#8217;s not acceptable now; I&#8217;m
gradually starting to understand&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Also: get a designer. My graphical guy (who would probably be called an
&#8220;art director&#8221; if we were, say, Electronic Arts rather than just two
blokes) went on and on about getting the typography and spacing right,
and we went backwards and forwards on it repeatedly. And he&#8217;s right: it
all feels better now. Thank you, Mike. If you need someone who&#8217;s great
at this stuff, let me know and I&#8217;ll put you in&nbsp;touch.</p>

<h3>Submitting the&nbsp;app</h3>
<p>At this point, I&#8217;ve built an app, I&#8217;m happy with it, and I&#8217;ve got a
click package for it. Time to add it to the store so other people can
play it! This will therefore be a laundry list of little complaints
about the smoothness of the app submission process. Before I start,
though, I should say this: it is fantastic that I can make an app and
submit it and have it show up in the store after about 20 minutes. The
team who built this and who do the reviews deserve congratulation:
everything I outline below is merely a slightly roughened corner on an
otherwise good process, and I&#8217;m confident that most of these issues are
already known and that all of them will be fixed. In particular, I
believe that it should be possible soon to submit an app direct from
&#8220;Ubuntu <span class="caps">SDK</span>&#8221;, meaning that this whole web-based submission process will
largely go away (although for people doing custom builds it will still
need to stay around, of course). I should say that even if
submission-from-the-<span class="caps">IDE</span> becomes a reality, there should be a
<code>submit-to-the-app-store</code> command line tool to do it as well (which
would do all the same stuff), so people with custom builds can use it
and you&#8217;re not wholly tied to the <span class="caps">IDE</span>.</p>
<p>On the first screen of submitting an app, you&#8217;re asked for an
&#8220;application name&#8221; and a &#8220;package name&#8221;. I at first thought that the
&#8220;application name&#8221; was the human name for my app (&#8220;Riddling&#8221;) and the
&#8220;package name&#8221; was the techie computer name which the click package is
called (<code>org.kryogenix.riddling</code>). However, the &#8220;package name&#8221; doesn&#8217;t
allow dots in it. After being hugely baffled by this, I asked on <span class="caps">IRC</span>,
and popey confirmed that the &#8220;package name&#8221; is the <em>last bit</em> of the
techie computer name: that is, <em>all</em> my apps are
&#8220;org.kryogenix.<em>something</em>&#8221; and the &#8220;package name&#8221; is the <em>something</em>.
The &#8220;org.kryogenix.&#8221; bit is called your &#8220;namespace&#8221;, and you select it
when you first sign up for app submission; the &#8220;package name&#8221; is then
glued onto the end of your namespace to make the name that the click
package is&nbsp;called.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re asked for a &#8220;tagline&#8221;, a one-line description of your app. There
are four different places to describe your app: the &#8220;tagline&#8221; in the
submission process, the &#8220;description&#8221; in the submission process, the
&#8220;description&#8221; in your <code>manifest.json</code> file, and the &#8220;Comment&#8221; in your
<code>appname.desktop</code> file. It is not at all clear what the difference
between these is. This, I think, could be solved by showing, as part of
the app submission process, what the app preview in the Dash will look
like for users once the app is submitted. What I discovered is that the
<code>manifest.json</code> <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>description&#8221; is currently ignored (but will presumably
become important once submission is done from the <span class="caps">IDE</span>), the
<code>appname.desktop</code> <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Comment&#8221; is also ignored, and the &#8220;tagline&#8221; and
&#8220;description&#8221; are shown one after the other in the Dash app preview when
installing an app. So if you have a paragraph which describes your app,
the &#8220;tagline&#8221; should be the first sentence of it and the &#8220;description&#8221;
should be the&nbsp;remainder.</p>
<p>The submission process asks for a 256x256px <span class="caps">PNG</span> icon. This icon is used
by the Dash when looking at an uninstalled app, but it is <em>not</em> used as
the icon for your app once the app is installed. Instead, the icon used
once the app is installed is the one named as <code>Icon</code> in
<code>appname.desktop</code>. There&#8217;s no guidance as to the size that this icon
should be (I have emailed the Canonical design team asking for such
guidance as part of the ongoing App Design Clinics), but I can tell you
that 64x64 is too small and your icon will be zoomed up and look blurry.
I used the same 256x256 icon that I added in the submission process, and
that worked fine: nice sharp icon on the&nbsp;phone.</p>
<p>The &#8220;required hardware&#8221; option in the submission process says &#8220;<span class="caps">PC</span> Only&#8221;,
and that&#8217;s all you can choose. That puzzled me for a while &#8212; surely
there should be a &#8220;phone&#8221; option? What&#8217;s the point of providing a
dropdown for this if there&#8217;s only one entry in it? &#8212; but I assume that
this will change later, so just choose &#8220;<span class="caps">PC</span> Only&#8221; for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is currently no way to install a click package on the
Ubuntu desktop. The process of developing an app, making a click
package, and submitting it is rather excellent, but it&#8217;s close to
impossible to make your app also available to Ubuntu desktop users,
which would massively increase the number of people who are able to use
it. Even if an app is built with convergence in mind &#8212; if it alters its
display for more screen real estate, as Karma Machine does, or if it&#8217;s
happy running in a small window and there&#8217;s no need to change, as
Riddling is &#8212; actually getting the app to desktop users can&#8217;t really be
done right now. I understand the reasoning here; click packages will be
able to be installed on the desktop in the next release, and that&#8217;ll be
fantastic. Right now, though, apps you build are to all intents and
purposes phone only, unless you&#8217;re prepared to provide a bunch of techie
instructions about installing dependencies and checking out bzr
branches, or you&#8217;re prepared to build a <code>.deb</code> package. This will be
cool once it&#8217;s improved, but right now it&#8217;s&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<h3>In&nbsp;summary</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed making Riddling (and from the feedback, people are
enjoying playing it). It&#8217;s clear to me that all the moving parts of &#8220;the
Ubuntu platform&#8221; are coming together to make something which is great to
write apps for and <em>easy</em> to write and distribute apps for, and that&#8217;s
what I want from my <span class="caps">OS</span> of choice. All the stuff I mention above will be
fixed soon, I&#8217;m sure. Meanwhile, while you&#8217;re waiting for that, open up
the Dash on your phone and search for &#8220;Riddling&#8221;. Maybe you&#8217;ll be the
first to get to the&nbsp;end!</p>
