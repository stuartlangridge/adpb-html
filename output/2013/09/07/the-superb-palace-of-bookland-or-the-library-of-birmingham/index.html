			<p>People are queueing up. To get into a library.</p>
<p>Not a One Direction concert. A library.</p>
<p>I love this city.</p>
<p>This is the Library of Birmingham, opened this week after six years of
planning and construction. It's the largest in Europe.</p>
<p>In front of the library is an open-air theatre at the bottom of a pit.
Actors are declaiming below as if 'twere Shakespeare's time, and crowds
are gathered to watch. Couples stand hand-in-hand and marvel at the
loveliness of it all.</p>
<p>Or maybe they're just a bit hung over. (This is still Birmingham, after
all.) They might be overawed by the neon lighting on the escalators. It
looks like Minority Report. But for books.</p>
<p>People are walking around with mouths open taking pictures of it. In a
library. The government are shutting down libraries when they can. We're
told that Google makes them obsolete. And people are queued up to get
inside. Vive la difference, eh?</p>
<p>There's a live choir on the top floor, which I assume won't be here when
it's not opening week, but it does make me feel like William of
Baskerville. Or Adso, anyway. There are computers all over the place,
with open source OpenOffice and the Gimp on them (and MS Office and
iTunes too). There's a Contemplation Room, for what I know not (well,
for contemplation obviously, but contemplation of what? The eternal
oneness? What Billie-Joe Macallister threw off the Tallahatchee Bridge?
Whatever miracle it was that got this place built?) And everywhere there
are people looking at books, talking about books, picking up books,
reading books.</p>
<p>Apparently Sarah Rowell, head of marketing for the Library, told the BBC
“We want to get over the notion that libraries are quiet places where
you’ll be shushed if you raise your voice ... there’s room for activity,
noise, joining-in and getting together with friends.” If you run into
her at any point, buy her a drink or something. That's how libraries
should be. Reverent but not hands-off. Teach your kids to love books,
not to treat them as untouchable museum objects or as irrelevances in
the age of Facebook. I myself read mostly ebooks and listen to
audiobooks, both of which the Library provides, and there's the obvious
question of why you need a big building to put books in when an iPhone
app can do it instead. The Library of Birmingham is the answer to that
question, and that Birmingham city council were prepared to build it is
one of the reasons I really like it here.</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman told us that libraries are our friends. The late, great
Borges thought that Paradise might be a kind of library, and he'd know.
If the librarians of heaven want somewhere to model their place on, they
could do a lot worse than the Library of Birmingham. Go visit. Today.</p>
