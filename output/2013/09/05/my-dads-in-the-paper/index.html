			<p>Bit of backstory, here. A while back, Tesco<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-1-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-1" class="simple-footnote" title="Tesco's? Tescos? It is entirely unclear. I have resolved to be completely inconsistent in my spelling of it throughout this post as a form of protest">1</a></sup> opened a
new store in Potton, the town where I grew up and my parents still
live<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-2-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-2" class="simple-footnote" title="I don't live there any more because, well, because stuff like the Tesco's car park gets on the front page of the newspaper">2</a></sup>. As
part of the agreement, they apparently said that people could park in
the supermarket's car park even if they weren't actually shopping at
Tesco, which is a bit of a boon for the already-overcrowded Market
Square in the town<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-3-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-3" class="simple-footnote" title="overcrowded in the sense that it was designed for the days when the shoppers were one man buying a bottle of pop and a sausage roll, and now everyone in town has three 4x4s and tries to park them all outside the library">3</a></sup>. Now, whether this little agreement
actually got written down anywhere seems rather unclear<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-4-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-4" class="simple-footnote" title="it is stuff like this that makes you understand a bit more how Watergate happened">4</a></sup>. Nonetheless, it seemed to be being adhered to until a
few weeks ago, when mysterious signs appeared saying that you might get
fined when parking there if you didn't park in the correct bays, or if
you weren't shopping. Oops.</p>
<p>So my old man, town councillor and champion of the downtrodden that he
is<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-5-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-5" class="simple-footnote" title="our daughters' daughters will adore us!">5</a></sup>, went on the
warpath. And today that's apparently been reversed: you are now again
free to park in Tesco's car park even if you aren't shopping there.
Hooray. You should all get in your cars and drive <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/0tN3V">there</a> now, park in
their car park, and then walk across the road to the Co-op and buy stuff
from there instead. Buy a pint from Mick in the George and Dragon while
you're there and tell him I said hello.</p>
<p>Also, the local paper reported on it<sup id="sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-6-back"><a href="#sf-my-dads-in-the-paper-6" class="simple-footnote" title="spelled our name wrong once and right the rest of the time, which is just ONE MORE EXAMPLE of the APPALLING BIAS shown by the MAINSTREAM MEDIA">6</a></sup>, and dad even got his
picture on the front page. That's four seconds of his fifteen gone.
Fight the power! Nice one, dad.</p>
