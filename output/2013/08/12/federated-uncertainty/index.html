			<p>Tim Bray from Google is <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/08/08/FC1-What-is-disclosed">starting a conversation about "federated
login"</a>, the idea of logging into websites using your
Google/Facebook/Twitter/something identity. It starts well, with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you click on the dark-blue button to sign in with Facebook (or
bright red for Google) what does Facebook (or Google) learn about you?
What does the app you’re signing into learn about you? Uncertainty
makes people nervous about federated login.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but unfortunately I think Tim's missed a reasonable proportion of the
point here. You see, there are two questions asked there:</p>
<ol>
<li>When I log in to GreatNewApp with my Google identity, what does
    GreatNewApp learn about my Google identity and what can they do with
    that information?, and</li>
<li>When I log in to GreatNewApp with my Google identity, what do
    <strong>Google</strong> learn about me and what can they do with that
    information?</li>
</ol>
<p>and Tim then goes on to only treat the first of those questions. I think
that the second question is a big part of the reason why people are
"nervous about federated login".</p>
<p>When you sign in to an app with Google, you see, as Tim notes, a thing
showing you what the app can know about your Google identity. At the
bottom of that thing in tiny writing is "Google will use this
information in accordance with their respective terms of service and
privacy policies". Which means <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="current-google-signin" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/current-google-signin.png"></p>
<p>I've spoken to a few people about this; most importantly my daughter.
She's not massively technical, and she's a <em>heavy</em> Facebook user. We
talked about "Sign in with Facebook" buttons, and what she thinks. And
she doesn't use them. I asked why, and she said "because then Facebook
posts on your wall that you're using that app and I don't want it to".
It's similar with other people; as far as I can tell, the biggest worry
is not that GreatNewApp might do something weird with your Google
information, it's that <em>Google</em> will do something weird with it.</p>
<p>Perhaps that dialog should look like this.</p>
<p><img alt="proposed-google-signin" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/proposed-google-signin.png"></p>
<p>It's not about what the RP (that is: GreatNewApp) can do with your
information, Tim. That's important, but it's already taken care of;
everyone involved in federated identity in any way spends all their time
worrying about that. In talking to people, the biggest example of this
is "sign in with Twitter"; if you sign in to an app with Twitter and
Twitter displays "this app can read your direct messages" and "this app
can tweet as you", everyone's justifiably worried: this thing is going
to spam my friends with messages about itself! I don't want that! And
that's correct. The existing federated systems deal with this problem —
with the issue of apps doing things to your Google or Twitter or
Facebook account — quite well. That's now not the concern.</p>
<p>It's about what the IDP -- Google, Facebook, Twitter -- can do and will
do with your information, either now or in the future. If someone at
Google (or at Facebook, or Twitter, or at my OpenID provider) starts
building a new social network and says "hey, we know what everyone's
signed in to: why don't we add an 'Apps I Like' column to this new
network and show it to all the user's friends?"... is that allowed by
the current "terms of service"? Will the "terms of service" change so
that suddenly it <em>is</em> allowed? When I sign in with Google, what does
<em>Google</em> do with that information? Are there any constraints at all?</p>
<p>That's what people are worried about, when I've asked them. It's not
just about protecting your Google identity from random applications.
It's about protecting your use of the internet from whatever Google want
to do with it. Will a new post appear on my Google+ saying "Stuart just
signed up with GreatNewApp"? Not created <em>by</em> GreatNewApp, but created
by Google+ itself? There will be some who will say, Google will never do
that. But I bet you'd believe it of Facebook, wouldn't you? As Tim said
right at the beginning, uncertainty makes people nervous about federated
login. Let's be certain about what all the parties are going to do with
the information that I've just signed in somewhere, and let's help
everyone else feel certain too.</p>
