			<p>I've got a computer in my cellar. It's where media lives, and a bunch of
little web apps that I've written to do stuff that I care about. It'd be
handy to be able to get at those little web apps from my phone,
wheresoever my phone is. However, I don't want to just expose the server
to the vagaries of the web. So, a few steps.</p>
<h4>Make sure the server can be connected to by SSH</h4>
<p>SSH, as I imagine most readers know, is the <em>secure shell</em>; a way to
connect to a computer's command line as if you were sitting at it. (For
Ubuntu computers, anyway. I think Macs have ssh too; Windows computers
generally don't.) I'm fairly sure that ssh comes out of the box on
Ubuntu, but if not there's <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html">a page in the help guide about setting it
up</a>.</p>
<h4>Make sure that I can connect to that server over SSH from outside</h4>
<p>Like most people, I've got a router which connects to my ISP and
provides wired network and wifi to the house, and the server computer in
the cellar is connected to it. However, you can't connect to computers
inside my house from outside the house: your connection gets as far as
my router and then stops. The way to change this is <em>port forwarding</em>;
when you try and connect to my router on a particular port, it actually
sends that connection through the router and into a particular computer
in the house. SSH runs on port 22, so set up the router so that it
forwards port 22 on itself to port 22 on the server computer. (How to do
this is very router-specific. RTFM.)</p>
<h4>Give your house a name on the internet</h4>
<p>Normally, while the house -- while the router, I should say -- is
connected to the internet, it can be connected <em>to</em> with its IP address;
a string of digits like a telephone number. Of course, these are hard to
remember, which is why everyone uses domain names: ubuntu.com rather
than 91.189.94.156. The IP address for your router will occasionally
change (most ISPs charge you extra for a "static IP" which does not
change), so you want something which will give your router a domain
name, an easy-to-remember alias for the IP address, and keep it up to
date when the IP address changes. For this I use <a href="http://dyndns.org">DynDNS.org</a> who I've
had an account with for years. Sign up for an account and you get a
name, like whatever.dyndns.org, which you can point at your IP address.</p>
<h4>Keep the domain name up to date when your IP changes</h4>
<p>To keep the name up to date, I installed <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/ddclient/">ddclient</a> on the server
computer, and taught it about my DynDNS account. Now, when my IP address
changes, ddclient will update dyndns.org so that my chosen domain name
correctly points at the new IP address.</p>
<h4>Connect from your phone</h4>
<p>I installed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vssh-lite/id535055496?mt=8">vSSH Lite</a> from the iPhone app store. I can now connect
from my phone to <em>mychosenname</em>.dyndns.org and log in with my username
and password, and I've got the command line on my server!</p>
<h4>More port forwarding, to connect to the web server</h4>
<p>But I don't really want the command line: what I want is to connect to
the web apps on the server. For this, use SSH's port forwarding feature.
This is a bit different from the port forwarding above; instead of the
router passing connections through itself, what this does is make a
local port on your phone connect to a remote port on the server. So, I
connect to my server with SSH, and port forward <em>local port</em> 8080 to
<em>remote port</em> 80. Then, I can open up iPhone Safari and browse to
http://localhost:8080/ and I'm <em>actually</em> connecting to the web server
on my computer in the cellar. Which was the goal.</p>
<p>Techie people will already know this stuff, of course. But it's quite
cool to be able to glue together all these little parts.</p>
