		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>A couple of days ago, someone asked me whether the Gmail website was any
good on mobile. I said: it seems so, the couple of times I&#8217;ve used it,
but I&#8217;m not really sure. I&#8217;ll find out, I&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d know better by&nbsp;now.</p>
<h4>once more into the breach, dear&nbsp;enemies</h4>
<p>The way to actually find out whether it&#8217;s any good, with the gmail web
app as with all things, is to use it for real for a bit. So I decided
that what I&#8217;d do is exclusively use the web app to read my mail on my
phone for a&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>There are two base criteria here which must be met. First: I have to be
able to get at gmail from an icon on my iPhone&#8217;s home screen, and second
I have to get notifications when I get a new mail. Those two things are
axioms, here: if they&#8217;re not possible, then my answer is &#8220;the gmail web
app is crap&#8221; because I can&#8217;t use it. The easy bit&nbsp;first.</p>
<h4>the easy&nbsp;bit</h4>
<p>Go to gmail.com in the browser: press the share button, press &#8220;add to
home screen&#8221;.&nbsp;Done.</p>
<h4>notifications for a new&nbsp;email</h4>
<p>Web apps have a notification <span class="caps">API</span>, but it&#8217;s not useful on mobiles,
because the whole point of a new mail notification is that you get it
even if you&#8217;re not looking at your mail app. You wouldn&#8217;t want to keep
the gmail web page open all the time, even if you were allowed to do so
on a phone, which you are not. (The Nokia N9 allowed this. No-one else
does; mobile platforms routinely decide to quietly kill your app and
then raise it from the dead again when you want it back, and while it&#8217;s
dead it&#8217;s not notifying anybody of anything, because it&#8217;s dead). So, we
need a way for me to get a notification that I have a new email. This
requires some sort of native app on the phone, fine, <span class="caps">OK</span>, but I didn&#8217;t
want to have to <em>write</em> a native app to do it; someone must have written
an app which can handle notifications and then open up gmail in the web
browser. And indeed it is so: on the iPhone there&#8217;s Boxcar and Prowl. (I
assume there are similar for Android.) Prowl costs money, so I looked at
Boxcar first. Boxcar does, indeed, allow you to have it get
notifications when you get a new email and then do some sort of
user-specified activity when a notification comes in, hooray! (It does
this by giving you a magic email address: you tell gmail to forward all
your mail to that email address, and when it gets an email, it sends
your phone a notification and then deletes the email. This requires
trusting the Boxcar people, I agree, but the purpose of this exercise
was to see if this could be done at all. If you want security, run your
own webmail server, or your own server which monitors gmail and then
send the notifications yourself, that&#8217;s fine; Boxcar can help with that
too via their <span class="caps">API</span>.)</p>
<h4>the easy bit… is never <em>that</em>&nbsp;easy</h4>
<p>So, at this point, when I get an email, Boxcar shows a notification: I
press the notification, and it opens my configured <span class="caps">URL</span>, which is
gmail.com. This is great and I should be done by now, except&#8230;Boxcar
opens my chosen address in a little in-built web view rather than my
browser. Lots of iPhone apps do this &#8212; build in a webview rather than
using the browser &#8212; and it really, really irritates me. There is no
option to say &#8220;open this in the browser, damn you!&#8221;&nbsp;Grr.</p>
<p>But, after some poking around, I notice that the <a href="http://blog.boxcar.io/post/8699108879/boxcar-4-2-1-whats-new">Boxcar changelog</a>
says &#8220;<span class="caps">NEW</span>: Add ability to open custom safari:// URLs in MobileSafari.&#8221;
Aha! That sounds like what I want. So&#8230; I configure my custom <span class="caps">URL</span> to be
<code>safari://mail.google.com</code>,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t work. Nor does <code>safari://http://mail.google.com</code>, or any
other combination I could think of. There is no documentation other than
the above changelog line.&nbsp;Frustrated.</p>
<p>Then I thought: well, it doesn&#8217;t have to be <em>Safari</em>, per se. I have
Google Chrome on the phone too. Maybe I can use that. The iPhone is set
up so that apps routinely register custom <span class="caps">URL</span> schemes: it&#8217;s how they
communicate. Is there, wondered I, some sort of custom <span class="caps">URL</span> scheme that I
can use to force an https link to open in Chrome rather than&nbsp;Safari?</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/ios-links">Indeed there is</a>. Well done Chrome people. If I open
<code>googlechromes://mail.google.com</code> it opens <code>https://mail.google.com</code> in
Chrome. Yay! So I configure <strong>that</strong> as my link in Boxcar. Now when I
get an email, I touch the notification, and gmail opens in Chrome!
Hooray! We&#8217;re&nbsp;done!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not done. Now, you see, my home screen link opens in Safari, and
my Boxcar link opens in Chrome. That&#8217;s annoying and wrong. So, how do I
edit the home screen link to be to <code>googlechromes://mail.google.com</code>?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t edit a home screen bookmark once it&#8217;s created. Bah.
So, how do I make Chrome bookmark something to the home&nbsp;screen?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t. Only Safari can do that, because it&#8217;s allowed the magic
secret APIs and no-one else&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>So how do I put a Chrome bookmark on my home screen? Well, one way would
be to have an <span class="caps">HTML</span> file which meta refreshes to the <code>googlechromes:</code>
<span class="caps">URL</span>, and bookmark the <span class="caps">HTML</span> file in Safari. That way, I&#8217;ll press the home
screen icon, that&#8217;ll start Safari, Safari will instantly start Chrome,
and I&#8217;ll have a bookmark. Slightly inelegant, but not too&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>I stuck the <span class="caps">HTML</span> page on my site, and tried it. Minor problem: the page
refreshes before I can bookmark it! So, remove the meta refresh, open
the page in Safari, bookmark it, put the meta refresh back in again. Ha!
That works. (And add a nice home screen icon with
<code>&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>New problem. Every time I hit the home screen bookmark, or the link from
Boxcar, we open a new tab in Chrome with gmail in it. After ten minutes
of testing this, I&#8217;ve got fifteen gmail tabs in Chrome. That&#8217;s no good.
The <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/mobile/docs/ios-links">Chrome links</a> doc dictates how to explicitly say
&#8220;I want a new tab&#8221;, but <em>not</em> how to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want a new tab: reuse
the previous one&#8221;. After a bit more poking around, though, you can use
an <a href="http://x-callback-url.com/specifications/">x-callback-url</a>-style <span class="caps">URL</span> with Chrome, and that lets you specify
a source. So, instead of making my bookmark and my Boxcar <span class="caps">URL</span> be
<code>googlechromes://mail.google.com</code>, I&#8217;ll make it be
<code>googlechrome-x-callback://x-callback-url/open/?x-source=boxcar&amp;&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com</code>.
That way, when you open that link a second time, it stays in the same
tab as the first time!&nbsp;Hooray!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect. I can&#8217;t get Boxcar links and the home screen link to
share a tab <em>between</em> them, so I end up with two Gmail tabs in Chrome.
That&#8217;s annoying but not a total crisis. And this is now clean enough
that I can stand to use it for a week. Now I get to actually try using
the Gmail web app for a week and see what it&#8217;s&nbsp;like!</p>
<h4>how annoying is the&nbsp;iPhone?</h4>
<p>This all seems like a great big faff to me. Is that all the iPhone&#8217;s
fault? Well… certainly some of it is. All that crap with Safari being
the only thing that can bookmark to the home screen? You can&#8217;t add home
screen bookmarks that aren&#8217;t to real URLs? Sure, these things are fairly
technical, but they don&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;d get in anyone&#8217;s way if they
did exist. Apparently in older versions of iOS you could bookmark (via a
roundabout data <span class="caps">URL</span> procedure) weird URLs such as <code>pref:something</code> to
open a Settings page directly, and Apple took that away. So that&#8217;s&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<p>But in general, I think that the approach of having a server monitor my
email and then use the platform&#8217;s push notification service to tell me
about it and open the webmail client&#8230;seems like a good approach.
Android does seem to have a couple of <span class="caps">IMAP</span> notify apps in the Play
Store, but they aren&#8217;t reviewed very well, and I don&#8217;t really <em>want</em> my
phone to hang on an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> <span class="caps">IDLE</span> socket 24 hours a day. Avoiding that is
precisely what push notifications (Google&#8217;s &#8220;Cloud to Device Messaging&#8221;)
were <em>invented</em> for. (Note: there are lots of mail notification apps,
but they poll. I don&#8217;t want polling. When I get an email, I want a
notification. Not five minutes&nbsp;later.)</p>
<p>So, then&#8230; is this doable on Android? Is there an app like Boxcar where
there&#8217;s a server component which can (somehow) monitor my gmail account
and notify my Android phone, and then pressing the notification on my
Android phone will open up <code>https://mail.google.com</code> in the phone&#8217;s
browser? I&#8217;d be interested in hearing the answer to this, Android-using&nbsp;readers.</p>
<p>What about other platforms? How will Firefox <span class="caps">OS</span> handle this? (Maybe
because they&#8217;re all web, they&#8217;ll just keep the web page open without
ever suspending it, and let it use the web notification <span class="caps">API</span>?) I&#8217;d like
to hear about other approaches. (I <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to hear &#8220;just use the
native app&#8221;. Of <em>course</em> that&#8217;s the logical thing to do. The point here
is to see whether I can set up my life so using a web app for email on
my phone is a doable thing. If your answer is &#8220;you need to use the
native app&#8221;, then I&#8217;ll take that as you saying &#8220;you can&#8217;t use web apps
for this; you have to go native&#8221;. That&#8217;s a perfectly reasonable
argument, but this post is not directed at you if that&#8217;s how you&nbsp;feel.)</p>
<p>Fun little project of gluing together technical bits, I must say.
Constraints are the mother of&nbsp;inventiveness!</p>
