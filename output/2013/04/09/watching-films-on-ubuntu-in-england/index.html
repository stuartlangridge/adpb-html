			<p>So there I was last week at my parents’ house, and my dad said: I am
thinking of getting Netflix.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Oh?”, says I. “What brought this on?”</p>
<p>Questions like that end up turning into long discussions, and this was
no exception. Those of you with the attention span of a four-year-old
will find a summary at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>He explained (in response to my question) that he likes the idea of
watching films and it’s probably easier and probably cheaper and
probably less hassle to do that in your own living room rather than the
cinema, especially since the nearest cinema to him is probably 15 miles
away. I pointed out that the available films will lag behind the cinema
releases (so if you see an ad for, say, Star Trek Into Darkness<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-1-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-1" class="simple-footnote" title="not Star Trek: Into Darkness">1</a></sup> on the side of a bus, you can’t <em>watch</em>
it in your living room <em>now</em>) but that they lag behind a consistent
amount (so all the films that hit the cinema 12 months ago<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-2-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-2" class="simple-footnote" title="or 18 months ago, or whatever the time lag actually is">2</a></sup> arrive online at
now, roughly, so all the films which were contemporarily released with
one another are <em>still</em> contemporary with one another), and that there
are multiple different providers of this sort of thing (Netflix,
Lovefilm, Now <span class="caps">TV</span>). And I pointed out<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-3-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-3" class="simple-footnote" title="a touch shamefacedly">3</a></sup> that
this would be a bit of a problem technically, because the computer
plugged into the big <span class="caps">TV</span> in the living room runs Ubuntu, and you can’t
watch commercial streaming video on Ubuntu<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-4-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-4" class="simple-footnote" title="he wants instant gratification: being able to go from “I want to watch a film” to “I am watching a film” in seconds. This means that a DVD rental service is no good for his use case">4</a></sup> because it all requires <span class="caps">MS</span> PlayReady
<span class="caps">DRM</span><sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-5-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-5" class="simple-footnote" title="yes, Silverlight, but Silverlight itself is not the problem">5</a></sup> and there’s no Ubuntu implementation of that, and so this
meant that we’d need to install Windows on that <span class="caps">TV</span> computer
instead.<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-6-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-6" class="simple-footnote" title="yes, I know about the Netflix-under-Wine stuff in Ubuntu. Read on">6</a></sup></p>
<h4>so, like, wassitallabout?</h4>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>How does it work?”, says my dad. “Well,” said I, settling into the
chair and adopting a wise look, “you pay a monthly subscription, and
then pick any film you want and watch it whenever you want for free,
beyond the subscription. I think if you watch the very latest films then
they might charge an extra cost because it’s a really recent film, but
you’re already waiting 12 months before it hits Netflix <em>at all</em>; you
might as well just set your clock to 18 months behind and watch a film
once it hits non-pay-per-view.” A nod from Dad. “Oh, and I think
occasionally there might be a film that Netflix doesn’t have: sometimes
there are little wars between them and, say, Amazon or Lovefilm<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-7-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-7" class="simple-footnote" title="yes I know Amazon own Lovefilm">7</a></sup> or Hulu or whatever, and a film is a
‘Netflix exclusive’ or something.”<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-8-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-8" class="simple-footnote" title="pause for brief explanation of how Netflix are remaking House of Cards in America">8</a></sup></p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>We should check that,” says my dad, a man for whom “films I want to
watch” has hitherto been <em>Zulu</em> and <em>The Great Escape</em>, but he’s
right<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-9-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-9" class="simple-footnote" title="and this is a massively unfair characterisation">9</a></sup>. Now
we pause here for twenty minutes while, with increasing disbelief and
shrillness, I discover that <strong>Netflix don’t provide a browseable list of
their films</strong>. They don’t. That’s <strong>insane</strong>. Also: you know how shops
that don’t display their prices are doing so because it’s all stupidly
expensive? Anyone who doesn’t display a list of their products is doing
so because that list is a lot shorter and less comprehensive than you
think it will be. So we poke around some more (I was honestly, properly
shocked by the absence of a list) and find a website that searches
Netflix and gives you a link. Commence another twenty minute block of
disbelief during which my dad names film after film after film he wants
to watch, or wouldn’t mind watching, or has always meant to watch… and
we find, I think, three. These weren’t all new films, weren’t all
obscure films, weren’t all old films: there was a good mix. And hardly
any of them were there.</p>
<h4>and the rat was nowhere at all</h4>
<p>Further research establishes that the rivals — Lovefilm, Now <span class="caps">TV</span>,
Blinkbox — are the same. I was under the impression that every one of
these online movie places had basically every film you’ve ever heard of,
and they compete on pricing, or access to the very latest films. It is
not like that.<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-10-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-10" class="simple-footnote" title="Maybe it is like that in America. It isn’t, here.">10</a></sup> Instead, Netflix and Lovefilm and Now <span class="caps">TV</span> have <em>basically no
films</em> for streaming and then every now and again they might have one.
That is: I thought that the model was “think on the bus of a film you
fancy watching, then go home and find it on Netflix and watch it”, and
the model is <em>totally not that</em>. Instead, the model is “decide you want
to watch a film, and set aside two hours for film-watchy time, and then
go to Netflix and choose a film from their list of films”. Or, in
practice, from the subset of their list of films that you actually want
to watch. That’s not necessarily a bad model — I’m sure new films come
into Netflix’s list faster than you can watch them, and you could
probably get quite a long way by just looking at their list and finding
all the stuff on it that you like the look of — but I totally
misunderstood (and so did Dad). I thought that Netflix were like Spotify
but for films, and they really ain’t.<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-11-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-11" class="simple-footnote" title="this is not necessarily a complaint. I understand that Netflix are not Spotify for films, and it is not Netflix’s fault that they are not Spotify for films. You think the music industry is full of back-alley cheating and under-the-table secret deals? Ha! You should see the movie people.">11</a></sup></p>
<h4>father, I shall bring you only the finest blank tv screens</h4>
<p>At this point he said, well, that’s crap then. I suppose I ought to go
to the cinema.</p>
<p>I said: well, if you have to do the just-choose-off-the-list thing
<em>anyway</em>, then why not just use a service who don’t charge a monthly
subscription? What I mean is: do it all pay-per-view. So then you’re not
paying when you’re not using it, and on any given day you can just do a
search and see if there’s anything you fancy watching (and paying for),
and if there isn’t, get in the car and go to the cinema instead. Best of
both worlds. I’m sure that if you watched ten films a week that Netflix
would be cheaper, but I don’t think that you’re gonna do that, daddy dearest.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, says daddy dearest. So, we do that, and put Windows on the computer, right?</p>
<p>Yep, I said. None of this stuff works on Ubuntu. Amazon Instant Video
works fine, and does exactly what you want, but (check briefly on
internet to confirm; briefly <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/1bcq23/legal_moviewatching_on_ubuntu_in_the_uk_without/">bitch on reddit</a> about this; go back to
dad) it’s <span class="caps">US</span> only. Soz.</p>
<h4>the sacred art of stealing</h4>
<p>We then have a little discussion about BitTorrent and theft of movies,
during which I basically say: it is not the solution for you. First, it
is really awkward and annoying. Popup ads, hundreds of different
websites, being able to tell the difference between a “download the
torrent” link which is real and one which is put there by an advert.
Torrent sites are blocked by ISPs in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. Yes, gentle reader, stop
sniggering at how this blocking approach is useless. Tt’s not meant to
stop you, you filthy techie pirate: it’s meant to be a speed bump which
makes it difficult for the unwashed masses to do this, to keep people
like my dad out of the torrent gutter and in paid-for shiny Netflix
territory… and it <strong>works</strong>.</p>
<p>I specifically recommended to dad that he not think about dealing with
this stuff through theft, because theft is <em>hard</em>. Try it, next time you
steal a movie: look at what you’re doing with the eyes of an
inexperienced person. A person who doesn’t have Adblock Plus, who isn’t
able to read through a list of search results and identify which ones
“look legit” and which look like spam, who isn’t able to tell which
links on a site are real and which download an exe. Theft is hard, and
frankly it’s fairly close to not being worth the pain. It’s fairly close
to it being easier to <em>just pay the money</em>. And that’s all the movie
people want. They don’t want to make it impossible, they don’t want to
studiously ignore that <span class="caps">DRM</span> doesn’t work, that blocking doesn’t work,
that they can’t shut down every Pirate Bay proxy… all they have to do
is make <strong>most</strong> people think “blimey, it’d be easier to pay the money
than do this”. To me it feels like that’s now fairly close to being the
case unless you’re a super techie (like most of the people reading this).</p>
<p>Also, y’know, <em>stealing</em>.</p>
<p>Also also: mkv. avi. srt. Do you really want to care about this stuff?
Learn what a “<span class="caps">BRRIP</span>” is? Learn whether the thing you’ve got has Italian
audio rather than English? Is
<code>"Incepcja - Inception DVDRip.XviD AC3 - ENG / Lektor PL"</code> <span class="caps">OK</span> to
download?<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-12-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-12" class="simple-footnote" title="I’ll be honest: I’m not sure myself. Looks like it’s got English audio and Polish subtitles? Don’t know.">12</a></sup> Srsly, hassle. Avoid.</p>
<h4>say that my glory was I had such friends</h4>
<p>While explaining BitTorrent and why it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,
a couple of very helpful people saw and commented on my Reddit post
complaining about this stuff. Google Play, they said… that’s in the
<span class="caps">UK</span>. Single-purchase pay-per-view videos, no subscription required. Dad’s
got an Android phone so he’s already got a Play account… and Play
Video works in Ubuntu?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It does, it turns out.</p>
<p><a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-09-182810.png"><img alt="Google Play Video in the Dash" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-09-182810.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-09-182840.png"><img alt="Google Play Video in the Dash: preview" src="http://kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Screenshot-from-2013-04-09-182840.png"></a></p>
<p>I was quite surprised by this.</p>
<h4>he saved every one of us</h4>
<p>You have to install <code>hal</code> to make Google Play work in Ubuntu<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-13-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-13" class="simple-footnote" title="if you don’t install hal, Flash obviously still works, but the movie just won’t play">13</a></sup>: to do this, search for <code>hal</code> in Ubuntu Software Centre and
then install it (“Hardware Abstraction Layer”)<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-14-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-14" class="simple-footnote" title="or sudo apt-get install hal from a terminal">14</a></sup>. This is the same thing
that Amazon Instant Video in the <span class="caps">US</span> needs. It’s using Adobe’s Flash <span class="caps">DRM</span>
stuff. This is good for us, we happy few, we Ubuntu users, because we
<em>have</em> Flash. We do not have the PlayReady <span class="caps">DRM</span> which is in
Silverlight<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-15-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-15" class="simple-footnote" title="we could have. Microsoft have not “refused” to put PlayReady on Ubuntu. They just haven’t done it, and why should they? what’s their motivation? I wouldn’t do it if I were them, right now">15</a></sup>, and which the movie studios are pressuring online video
people to switch to — that’s why Netflix doesn’t work in Ubuntu, that’s
why Lovefilm no longer works, why Now <span class="caps">TV</span> doesn’t work. Google Play, on
the other hand, works fine. Dad likes the pay-just-when-you-watch-a-film
model, and it works on his existing computer with his existing accounts;
he didn’t even have to sign up for anything. Just click and he’s bought
a film and can watch it. Right there in the web browser. No app required
at all.</p>
<p>It was literally that simple.</p>
<p>People on other platforms, who are not only used to the idea that it’s
that simple, but have hardly any concept that it might <em>not</em> be simple,
are laughing themselves sick right now at me being so childishly,
pathetically pleased by this. I personally am thinking: good work,
Google Play. You made that easy.</p>
<p>The film that Dad chose to watch… was Twilight. <em>Twilight.</em> You’re not
my real dad, dad.</p>
<h4>dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body</h4>
<p>This is worrying. (Not the Twilight thing.) Flash still exists on
Ubuntu, but Adobe have stopped making it. The <span class="caps">DRM</span> parts of it are
already dependent on <code>hal</code>, which is basically deprecated: Adobe built
the Flash <span class="caps">DRM</span> stuff into Flash and on Linux when <code>hal</code> was the thing,
and since then <code>hal</code> has stopped being the thing, but Adobe didn’t
update Flash to work with the replacement… and right at the moment it
doesn’t look like they will at all, because they’ve stopped doing Flash
for Linux. This means that at some point it will stop working. At the
moment it is possible to legitimately, legally, happily, easily watch a
Hollywood film on a stock, standard Ubuntu machine. Google Play can do
it in at least the <span class="caps">US</span> and the <span class="caps">UK</span>; Amazon Instant Video can do it in the
<span class="caps">US</span>. If Flash stops working, that goes away.</p>
<p>And <span class="caps">HTML5</span> will not save us. It will not. They’re talking about putting
<span class="caps">DRM</span> into <span class="caps">HTML5</span> video right now, but either they won’t do it (and then
there won’t be any commercial videos in <span class="caps">HTML5</span>, just like there aren’t
now) or they will do it and they’ll likely pick a <span class="caps">DRM</span> scheme which is
not implemented on Ubuntu and won’t be (highly likely to be something
like PlayReady, because the whole industry is already familiar with it).
A move away from Flash and towards anything else makes life measurably
<em>worse</em> for Ubuntu users, because we have Flash, and don’t have anything else.</p>
<h4>fight the work per unit time</h4>
<p>But you’re missing the point, man! We must fight <span class="caps">DRM</span>! It doesn’t work
and it’s evil and useless!</p>
<p>I agree with all that. But that’s a long-term fight. And no-one has yet
convinced me that there is a way to do it without selling the whole
world on the idea that they should just Stop Watching Movies until the
<span class="caps">DRM</span> goes away. And we, the <span class="caps">DRM</span>-haters, have had little to no success
convincing people to make that sacrifice.</p>
<p>The music industry is not a good guide here. What happened in music was
that all the players fought one another with different <span class="caps">DRM</span> schemes, no
cooperation, to try and beat out their rivals. And while they were doing
that, Apple came along and built something which was slick and easy to
use and had Apple-specific <span class="caps">DRM</span> in it and dominated the market. Then the
music industry said: it is our music, you have to play by our rules…
and Apple said: no we don’t. We really don’t. What are you going to do,
music people? Go and sell WMAs? Not likely. Everyone’s got an iPod now.
And Apple were right… and because everyone wanted to sell music to
iPod owners and didn’t want to do it through Apple’s sales channel, they
had to go <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free. Because that’s all that iPods would play. You could
see this as a great victory for consumer power, if you squint a bit.</p>
<p>The movie people, though (and this is an important point) are <em>not
stupid</em>. They have seen what happened to the music industry, have seen
that it ended up with all viable saleable music being <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free, and have
said: that’s not gonna happen to us. They are not going to fight and
bicker amongst themselves while Apple builds a royal road to all the
money. They are not going to knife one another. They’re going to get
together, swallow their pride a bit, and cooperate because they
recognise that one <span class="caps">DRM</span> system that everyone compromises a bit on is
better than a million and the eventual arrival of <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free videos. And
so they did cooperate: that’s what Ultraviolet is. And it does not
matter that Ultraviolet hasn’t taken off yet: it does not matter that it
is not a viable competitor to Netflix. The point is that it exists. The
movie people will not be forced into offering <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free movies because
they didn’t cooperate until it was too late. They have seen the mistakes
the music industry made, and won’t get caught the same way.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how, in the long term, the studios can be convinced to
not use <span class="caps">DRM</span>: that’s a good conversation to have. But it’s hard to see
how to do that now without telling my dad that he can’t watch Twilight
on Ubuntu even if he wants to.</p>
<h4>whataboutery</h4>
<p>One of the things about this whole topic of movies and <span class="caps">DRM</span> and Ubuntu
and stuff is that every sentence comes larded with a million caveats,
oh-but-what-abouts, roads-not-taken, sidebars, and other ancilliary
things. If you manage to find something where I said “and therefore X”
and didn’t mention that Y and Z also exist as possibilities, do not
assume that it is because I do not know about Y and Z. But tell me about them!</p>
<h4>tl; dr</h4>
<p>Summary: Google Play video works on stock Ubuntu, in your browser, and
exists here in England. It is, as far as I am aware, the <strong>only</strong>
legitimate, unhacky<sup id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-16-back"><a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-16" class="simple-footnote" title="installing a custom Wine and a PPA is hacky; using a US-based proxy is hacky.

it. So does my dad.</p>

complaint. I understand that Netflix are not Spotify for films, and it
is not Netflix’s fault that they are not Spotify for films. You think
the <em>music industry</em> is full of back-alley cheating and under-the-table
secret deals? Ha! You should see the movie people. <a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-11-back" class="simple-footnote-back">↩</a></li><li id="sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-12">I’ll be honest: I’m not sure myself. Looks like it’s got

PlayReady on Ubuntu. They just haven’t <em>done</em> it, and why should they?
what’s their motivation? I wouldn’t do it if I were them, right

using a <span class="caps">US</span>-based proxy is hacky. If you think it isn’t, that’s fine;
continue to think so, and we’ll agree to differ. <a href="#sf-watching-films-on-ubuntu-in-england-16-back" class="simple-footnote-back">↩</a></li></ol>
