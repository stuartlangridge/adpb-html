		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Recently, I was involved in an event where a video was shown, and the event was filmed. It would be nice to put the video of the event up somewhere so other people who weren't there could watch it. Obvious answer: upload it to YouTube. However, the video that was shown <em>at</em> the event is Copyrighted Media Content and therefore is disallowed by YouTube and the copyright holder; it's not demonetised (which wouldn't be a problem), it's flat-out blocked. So YouTube is out.</p>
<p>I'd like the video I'm posting to stick around for a long time; this is a sort of archival, reference thing where not many people will ever want to watch it but those that do might want to do so in ten years. So I'm loath to find some other random video hosting site, which will probably go bust, or pivot to selling online AI shoes or something. And the best way to ensure that something keeps going long-term is to put it on your own website, and use decent HTML, because that means that even in ten or twenty years it'll still work where the latest flavour-of-the-month thing will go the way of other old technologies and fade away and stop working over time. HTML won't do that.</p>
<p>But... it's an hour long and in full HD. 2.6GB of video. And one of the benefits of YouTube is that they'll make the video adaptive: it'll fit the screen, and the bandwidth, of whatever device someone's watching it on. If someone wants to look at this from their phone and its slightly-shaky two bars of 4G connection, they probably don't want to watch the loading spinner for an hour while it buffers a full HD video; they can ideally get a cut down, lower-quality but quicker to serve, version. But... how is this possible?</p>
<p>There are two aspects to doing this. One is that you serve up different <em>resolutions</em> of video, based on the viewer's screen size. This is exactly the same problem as is solved for images by the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element to provide responsive images (where if you're on a 400px-wide screen you get a 400px version of the background image, not the 2000px full-res version), and indeed the magic words to search for here are <em>responsive video</em>. And the person you will find who is explaning all this is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scottjehl.com">Scott Jehl</a>, who has written <a href="https://scottjehl.com/posts/using-responsive-video/">a good description of how to do responsive video</a> which explains it all in detail. You make versions of the video at different resolutions, and serve whichever one best matches the screen you're on, just like responsive images. Nice work; just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>But there's also a second aspect to this: responsive video adapts to screen size, but it doesn't adapt to bandwidth. What we want, in addition to the responsive stuff, is that on poor connections the viewer gets a lower-bandwidth version as well as a lower-resolution version, and that the viewer's browser can dynamically switch from moment to moment between different versions of the video to match their current network speed. This task is the job of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HTTP Live Streaming</a>, or HLS. To do this, you essentially encode the video in a bunch of different qualities and screen sizes, so you've got a bunch of separate videos (which you've probably already done above for the responsive part) and then (and this is the key) you chop up each video into a load of small segments. That way, instead of the browser downloading the whole one hour of video at a particular resolution, it only downloads the next <em>segment</em> at its current choice of resolution, and then if you suddenly get more (or less) bandwidth, it can switch to getting segment 2 from a <em>different</em> version of the video which better matches where you currently are.</p>
<p>Doing this sounds hard. Fortunately, all hard things to do with video are handled by ffmpeg. There's a nice writeup by Mux on <a href="https://www.mux.com/articles/how-to-convert-mp4-to-hls-format-with-ffmpeg-a-step-by-step-guide">how to convert an mp4 video to HLS with ffmpeg</a>, and it works great. I put myself together a <a href="https://gist.github.com/stuartlangridge/c0ae266306604c7db23e9855eea83976">little Python script</a> to construct the ffmpeg command line to do it, but you can do it yourself; the script just does some of the boilerplate for you. Very useful.</p>
<p>So now I can serve up a video which adapts to the viewer's viewing conditions, and that's just what I wanted. I have to pay for the bandwidth now (which is the <em>other</em> benefit of having YouTube do it, and one I now don't get) but that's worth it for this, I think. Cheers to Scott and Mux for explaining all this stuff.</p>
