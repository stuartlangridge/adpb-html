		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>The <span class="caps">BBC</span> are proposing to stop you watching <span class="caps">HD</span> television unless you go
out and buy all new equipment where the manufacturers have signed a
secret deal to implement restrictions. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/01/bbc-hd-consultation-hdmi">You can read more about this in the Guardian</a>. I, personally, don&#8217;t like this. <span class="caps">OFCOM</span> have <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/content_mngt/howtorespond/form">opened this up to public consultation</a>, but you only have until 5pm tomorrow
(Friday 2nd April) to get your opinions heard. My answers are&nbsp;below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Question 1: Do you agree that copy management would broaden the range of
<span class="caps">HD</span> content available on <span class="caps">DTT</span> and help secure its long term viability as a&nbsp;platform?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that copy management would broaden the range of <span class="caps">HD</span>
content available on <span class="caps">DTT</span>. Look at the outpouring of creativity
engendered by YouTube for an obvious counter-example. There is simply no
way that explicitly excluding part of the audience can lead to a larger&nbsp;audience.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 2: Do you agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s proposed multiplex licence
amendment represents the most appropriate means for securing an
effective content management system on <span class="caps">HD</span> <span class="caps">DTT</span>?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8217;s proposed licence amendment, or indeed any
licence amendment, represents any appropriate means for an &#8220;effective
content management system&#8221;. The <span class="caps">BBC</span> has operated since 1927 and become
the most successful and most loved broadcaster in the world by being
open with its work. To step back away from this now would be a drastic
failure in the <span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8217;s remit and&nbsp;standing.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 3: Do you agree with the proposed change to Condition 6 in the
Multiplex B&nbsp;Licence?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree with the proposed change. Restricting access to <span class="caps">EPG</span> data
is, frankly, legalised arm-twisting; it&#8217;s transparently a way to bring
in restrictions &#8220;by the back door&#8221;, and it&#8217;s disappointing to see the
<span class="caps">BBC</span>, an organisation that has always prided itself on openness, make
this suggestion. Calling oneself &#8220;<span class="caps">BBC</span> Free to View Ltd&#8221; and then
ensuring that &#8220;free to view&#8221; content is effectively not free by
restricting access to the <span class="caps">EPG</span> is a touch&nbsp;hypocritical.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 4: Do you agree that Multiplexes C and D should be granted a
similar amendment to their Licences as Multiplex&nbsp;B?.

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 5: Do you agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s proposed approach for
implementing content management would safeguard citizens and consumers
legitimate use of <span class="caps">HD</span> content, and if not, what additional guarantees
would be&nbsp;appropriate?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8217;s proposed approach would safeguard
legitimate use of <span class="caps">HD</span> content; on the contrary, it will explicitly
disallow legitimate use of <span class="caps">HD</span> content by citizens and consumers using
open-source technologies such as MythTV, citizens who wish to make their
technology choices based on price without having to pay the inevitable
price increase levied by firms who have struck a secret agreement and
then passed the resultant cost onto the consumer, and frankly any
British resident who enjoys consuming <span class="caps">BBC</span> content and does not want to
have their existing working equipment rendered obsolete without having
done anything&nbsp;wrong.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 6: Do you agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s proposed choice of content
management technologies will have only a negligible impact on the cost
of <span class="caps">HD</span> <span class="caps">DTT</span> receivers and their interoperability with other <span class="caps">HD</span> consumer
equipment?&nbsp;.

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the content maangement technology choices proposed
by the <span class="caps">BBC</span> will have a negligible impact on cost and interoperability.
Requiring consumers to buy new equipment is a cost in itself, especially
when that new equipment is deliberately incompatible with existing
equipment, such as <span class="caps">HD</span> TVs, which currently work but did not anticipate
an industry-led imposition of a Broadcast&nbsp;Flag.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 7: Do stakeholders agree that the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s proposed Huffman Code
licensing arrangements would have a negligible effect on the market for
<span class="caps">HD</span> <span class="caps">DTT</span>&nbsp;receivers?

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 8: Do the <span class="caps">BBC</span>’s proposed content management states and their
permitted use for different categories of <span class="caps">HD</span> content meet the
requirements of other <span class="caps">HD</span> broadcasters on <span class="caps">DTT</span>?

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
Go and leave your&nbsp;thoughts.
