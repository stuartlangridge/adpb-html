			<p>The BBC are proposing to stop you watching HD television unless you go
out and buy all new equipment where the manufacturers have signed a
secret deal to implement restrictions. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/01/bbc-hd-consultation-hdmi">You can read more about this in the Guardian</a>. I, personally, don't like this. OFCOM have <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/content_mngt/howtorespond/form">opened this up to public consultation</a>, but you only have until 5pm tomorrow
(Friday 2nd April) to get your opinions heard. My answers are below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Question 1: Do you agree that copy management would broaden the range of
HD content available on DTT and help secure its long term viability as a
platform?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that copy management would broaden the range of HD
content available on DTT. Look at the outpouring of creativity
engendered by YouTube for an obvious counter-example. There is simply no
way that explicitly excluding part of the audience can lead to a larger
audience.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 2: Do you agree that the BBC’s proposed multiplex licence
amendment represents the most appropriate means for securing an
effective content management system on HD DTT?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the BBC's proposed licence amendment, or indeed any
licence amendment, represents any appropriate means for an "effective
content management system". The BBC has operated since 1927 and become
the most successful and most loved broadcaster in the world by being
open with its work. To step back away from this now would be a drastic
failure in the BBC's remit and standing.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 3: Do you agree with the proposed change to Condition 6 in the
Multiplex B Licence?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree with the proposed change. Restricting access to EPG data
is, frankly, legalised arm-twisting; it's transparently a way to bring
in restrictions "by the back door", and it's disappointing to see the
BBC, an organisation that has always prided itself on openness, make
this suggestion. Calling oneself "BBC Free to View Ltd" and then
ensuring that "free to view" content is effectively not free by
restricting access to the EPG is a touch hypocritical.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 4: Do you agree that Multiplexes C and D should be granted a
similar amendment to their Licences as Multiplex B?.

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 5: Do you agree that the BBC’s proposed approach for
implementing content management would safeguard citizens and consumers
legitimate use of HD content, and if not, what additional guarantees
would be appropriate?

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the BBC's proposed approach would safeguard
legitimate use of HD content; on the contrary, it will explicitly
disallow legitimate use of HD content by citizens and consumers using
open-source technologies such as MythTV, citizens who wish to make their
technology choices based on price without having to pay the inevitable
price increase levied by firms who have struck a secret agreement and
then passed the resultant cost onto the consumer, and frankly any
British resident who enjoys consuming BBC content and does not want to
have their existing working equipment rendered obsolete without having
done anything wrong.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 6: Do you agree that the BBC’s proposed choice of content
management technologies will have only a negligible impact on the cost
of HD DTT receivers and their interoperability with other HD consumer
equipment? .

</dt>
<dd>
I do not agree that the content maangement technology choices proposed
by the BBC will have a negligible impact on cost and interoperability.
Requiring consumers to buy new equipment is a cost in itself, especially
when that new equipment is deliberately incompatible with existing
equipment, such as HD TVs, which currently work but did not anticipate
an industry-led imposition of a Broadcast Flag.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 7: Do stakeholders agree that the BBC’s proposed Huffman Code
licensing arrangements would have a negligible effect on the market for
HD DTT receivers?

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
<dt>
Question 8: Do the BBC’s proposed content management states and their
permitted use for different categories of HD content meet the
requirements of other HD broadcasters on DTT?

</dt>
<dd>
Unknown.

</dd>
Go and leave your thoughts.
