			<p>A fun game with <a href="http://seilo.geekyogre.com/">Seif Lotfy</a> of the <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com">Zeitgeist project</a> today, to
answer the question: how hard would it be to have my Zeitgeist event log
be in desktopcouch? That makes the logs from all my computers available
<em>on</em> all my computers. This is increasingly important as more stuff
starts going into Zeitgeist -- for example, we're going to start storing
lots of Ubuntu One events in there to make what's happening with Ubuntu
One on your machine more transparent and obvious, if you want to see it.
So, after some conversation where Seif told me it was easy and I scoffed
and bet him a beer that it wasn't...it turned out it wasn't that hard
after all.</p>
<p>Zeitgeist has extensions. These aren't brilliantly documented yet, but
you can drop a Python file into <code>.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions</code> and
if it's got the right sort of class in it then that class will get run
as a part of Zeitgeist. Extensions are great for doing things like
running some code every time there's an event which goes into Zeitgeist.
<code>/usr/share/zeitgeist/_zeitgeist/engine/extensions/blacklist.py</code> is an
example extension.</p>
<p>However, we didn't do it quite that way. Because we're taking an action
on <em>every</em> event in zeitgeist, we don't want to slow the core down. So
instead of actually being an extension that's built into the main
Zeitgeist process, we're an extension which launches a separate
subprocess. The subprocess uses <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/docs/0.5.2/client.html#zeitgeistclient">ZeitgeistClient</a> to get notified
whenever any event happens, and then serialises that event into
desktopcouch. Basically, it's an event-driven loop driven by
<code>ZeitgeistClient.install_monitor</code>, so every time a new event happens our
function gets called, and that function serialises the event into a
desktopcouch Record and saves it.</p>
<p>The other half of the equation is getting events <em>from</em> desktopcouch.
Obviously, if you've got more than one machine, then sometimes events
that happened on the other machine will arrive <em>here</em>, and you need to
pull those new records out of desktopcouch, turn then back into event
objects, and push them into the Zeitgeist engine. The way to do this
efficiently is by monitoring desktopcouch's <strong>changes feed</strong>. <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html">The changes feed</a> is a core part of CouchDB itself; the way it works is
that you open an HTTP connection to it and that connection lives
forever; whenever a record changes or is added or deleted to the
database you're monitoring, a line (actually, a JSON description) about
the change is printed to that HTTP connection. So you just watch that
feed forever, and whenever you get told "this record has changed", you
go fetch that record from desktopcouch in the normal way and then do
whatever you want with it. Nicely event-driven; no polling at all, no
wakeups if you don't need them.</p>
<p>Getting at the changes feed from a desktopcouch database is a little
more complex than getting at it from a server CouchDB, but it's doable,
and one of the things we plan to do in the Ubuntu 11.04 development
cycle is make this trivial to do: you'll just call
<code>databaseobject.glib_callback_for_changes(my_callback_function)</code> and
your callback will be called every time there's a change in the
database. (The code below contains a load of complex OAuth stuff to
derive a validated URL for the _changes feed; that's what we're going
to wrap up in that one line.)</p>
<p>I was pretty pleased to see how simple it is to interact with Zeitgeist,
and I plan for us to work more with the Zeitgeist team. Thanks
especially to Seif who talked me through a lot of this, and to whom I
owe a pint or something.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/desktopcouch_gateway.py">desktopcouch_gateway.py</a>; drop it in
<code>.local/share/zeitgeist/extensions</code>, and then restart the Zeitgeist
server with <code>zeitgeist-daemon --replace</code>.</p>
