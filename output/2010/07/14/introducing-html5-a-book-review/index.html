		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>There are two types of technical books. Reference manuals are useful;
you always have them to hand, and you can jump in and find a particular
page which gives you the stuff you need to know. They&#8217;re an
indispensable reference tool, unless, say, you have access to the
internet. Then, well, maybe they&#8217;re not as handy. On the other hand,
there&#8217;s the other sort of technical book; the sort that&#8217;s a pleasure to
read in itself, and you only realised you&#8217;ve learned things afterwards.
Such a book is Introducing <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5, by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp. As
they say at the beginning of the introduction: welcome to the Remy and
Bruce show. The book manages to be both a thorough introduction to the
swathe of modern and new web technologies masquerading under the name of
&#8220;<span class="caps">HTML5</span>&#8221;, and a personal voice which comments on the state of web
development today and in the near future. The tl;dr summary for people
who don&#8217;t want to read the rest: good web book is good. Get&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The book successfully and intelligently covers the new markup in <span class="caps">HTML5</span>
(nav/header/section/article, new input types in forms, and <span class="caps">WAI</span>-<span class="caps">ARIA</span>
accessibility) as well as the vast proliferation of new APIs available
to modern web applications (canvas, multimedia, offline storage,
workers, and geolocation, among others), drawing on the authors&#8217;
experience of user questions and articles at their html5doctor site.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s not a hagiography, and they don&#8217;t hesitate to stick
the boot in where it&#8217;s warranted; the current mess that is native
drag-and-drop support in browsers and the ridiculous codec war inherent
in online video both come in line for a justified kicking. Each chapter
covers its material in decent detail, without devolving into a mere list
of APIs; the book is full of both worked examples and links to relevant
extra resources. Unusually for a book of this type, the examples are
fairly real-world; instead of a contrived writeup to show off a feature,
they show how to mark up the home page of the Guardian newspaper with
<span class="caps">HTML5</span>&nbsp;elements.</p>
<p>Conspicuously missing from the book are the major changes to <span class="caps">CSS</span>
currently being implemented in browsers. A chapter covering the
transform and similar <span class="caps">CSS3</span> declarations (<code>-webkit-transform</code>,
<code>-moz-transform</code>, and the like) would have fit nicely, and it&#8217;s a shame
that this wasn&#8217;t covered &#8212; yes, it&#8217;s a book about <span class="caps">HTML5</span>, not <span class="caps">CSS3</span>, but
the authors themselves admit that by &#8220;<span class="caps">HTML5</span>&#8221; they actually mean &#8220;<span class="caps">HTML5</span>
and related specifications that came from the <span class="caps">WHATWG</span>&#8221;, and they throw in
geolocation just because &#8220;it&#8217;s really cool&#8221;. Advances in <span class="caps">CSS</span> which give
dynamic effects not only would fit well with the other subject matter
but would also make a few of the examples perhaps&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>The canvas chapter doesn&#8217;t bring much more than innumerable web pages
covering the basics of the canvas <span class="caps">API</span> for drawing, but it covers those
basics well and in a readable way. Importantly, there&#8217;s also a
discussion of the difference between using the canvas element for
drawing and using <span class="caps">SVG</span>, and when you&#8217;d choose one rather than the other.
It&#8217;s been difficult to find that sort of summary; it&#8217;s equally difficult
to decide yourself which to use for some new project, and the chapter&#8217;s
sidebar (or \&lt;aside>?) discussion of &#8220;when to use which&#8221; clarified the
distinction well, especially when going beyond reimplementations of
Super Mario Bros inside the&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>All is not sweetness and light, mind. The data storage chapter,
explaining how to use <span class="caps">HTML5</span>&#8217;s new in-the-browser storage objects,
breathlessly explains that this means an end to cookies (which are
&#8220;rubbish&#8221; according to the authors). However, this is where their
client-side bias seems to be coming through. Cookies are shared with the
server, too; snazzy <span class="caps">HTML5</span> storage is not. Any even reasonably detailed
web application will have a substantial server component, and abandoning
cookies will make it jolly hard to have the server and the front-end
share data. This does seem rather like excitement over the new tech
without thinking about how it can actually be used in real-world
situations, and is disappointing from a book which goes out of its way
to give suggestions that are actually useful to&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Another area the book falls down is in its editing: there are typos
scattered throughout the text (including in a heading in the
introduction, for goodness&#8217; sake!) and these should have been caught by
an editor; noticing them distracts the reader from the material, and
it&#8217;s a schoolboy error which damages the impact of the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>I know both the authors, and they&#8217;re both well-known and respected in
the web development community; Introducing <span class="caps">HTML5</span> does them credit, and
it&#8217;s worth your time. Go forth, get <a href="http://introducinghtml5.com/">Introducing <span class="caps">HTML5</span></a>, and make
great web&nbsp;stuff.</p>
