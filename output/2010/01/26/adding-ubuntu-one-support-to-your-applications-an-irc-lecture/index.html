		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>This year, as last year, I did an IRC talk as part of Ubuntu Developer
Week. This time, it was about adding Ubuntu One to your applications,
and what that will bring to your users. (Once again my <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/08/31/delivering-talks-by-irc-an-xchat-plugin">xchat plugin for
IRC talks</a> was massively helpful!</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! I'm Stuart Langridge, from the Ubuntu One team, and this talk is
    called "Adding Ubuntu One support to your applications".</li>
<li>You can ask questions at any time in #ubuntu-classroom-chat. Please
    write QUESTION at the beginning of your question so I can see it
    more easily. I'll stop at the end of a section and answer some
    questions.</li>
<li>During this talk I'm going to explain the different ways your
    applications can take advantage of Ubuntu One...</li>
<li>...talk about why you'd want to do that...</li>
<li>...and give a couple of sneak previews of things that you can't
    *quite* do yet but will be able to do for Lucid 10.04, so you can
    be ready!</li>
<li>Firstly, though, remember that "integrating with Ubuntu One" isn't
    really the point; the point is to give features to your users that
    make their lives easier.</li>
<li>Now, obviously, using Ubuntu One will make you taller, it'll make
    you more attractive to the appropriate sex, and it'll make the sun
    shine more brightly, but remember that it's all about providing
    things that your users want...</li>
<li>...and Ubuntu One gives you the infrastructure you need to do that.
    If it doesn't, come talk to us!</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to do cool things with file synchronisation</h3>
<ul>
<li>OK, so, the first thing is: files.</li>
<li>As you know, Ubuntu One automatically synchronises files in your
    Ubuntu One folder to Ubuntu One itself in the cloud and to all your
    other machines.</li>
<li>This means that you can take advantage of automatic file backup just
    by having your application save things to the filesystem!</li>
<li>Imagine that you want attachments that you receive by email to be
    stored online and backed up so you can get at them later.</li>
<li>Most mail clients will already let you do this in some way. So,
    change the folder that these attachments are saved in to be an
    Ubuntu One folder and suddenly all your attachments are backed up
    online and available on every machine!</li>
<li>For example, there is a Thunderbird attachment called "Attachment
    Extractor"
    (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/556">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/556</a>)</li>
<li>Install it, select "Automatically extract attachments on email
    receipt" in Tools &gt; AttachmentExtractor settings &gt; Auto-Extract,
    and set the "Save Path for Attachments" to /home/YOU/Ubuntu One/Mail
    Attachments, and that's all you need!</li>
<li>Similarly, if you want off-site backups of your computer, then you
    can install one of the many simple backup programs, like backintime
    (<a href="http://backintime.le-web.org/">http://backintime.le-web.org/</a>) and choose the backup folder to be
    inside your Ubuntu One folder.</li>
<li>With no extra effort you've got off-site online backups which you
    can get at from any of your machines or from the web.</li>
<li>As another example, imagine you've built yourself a digital picture
    frame out of an old laptop, which is a pretty cool project for your
    weekends. How do you get the photos on it?</li>
<li>Well, when I did this, I created a new Ubuntu One user for the
    picture frame, and then I shared a folder with that picture frame
    user through Ubuntu One.</li>
<li>The picture frame just did this: eog --slideshow
    "/home/pictureframe/Ubuntu One/Shared With Me/pictures from Stuart
    Langridge"</li>
<li>and then to add new pictures to the frame, I just copy them into the
    folder that I shared.</li>
<li>I could share that folder with anyone else, too, and allow them to
    write to it, and then they'd be able to add pictures to the frame
    too!</li>
<li>The way I'll do this from 10.04 Lucid onwards is to use the new User
    Defined Folders feature, where any folder, anywhere, can be
    designated as an Ubuntu One synced folder</li>
<li>and you can elect to have some folders but not others synced to
    particular machines</li>
<li>So I'd create my "digital picture frame" folder in my home folder
    (or wherever), and then mark it as a UDF.</li>
<li>Then on the picture frame itself, I'd sign into Ubuntu One, and say
    that I only want to subscribe to that particular UDF and not any of
    the others.</li>
<li>so then files that I put into "digital picture frame" on my laptop
    will be synced to the picture frame</li>
<li>and the picture frame just displays all the files in that folder</li>
<li>ta daaah, it Just Works.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Publishing files publically</h3>
<ul>
<li>A much-requested feature which will be available in Lucid is "public
    files", the ability to publish an Ubuntu One-synchronised file to a
    public URL so anyone can get at it.</li>
<li>This is useful for the user directly; they can easily make a file
    available to the world.</li>
<li>It's also really useful for applications, because you can now build
    one-click publish-to-the-world directly into your apps.</li>
<li>Imagine that your app is Shutter, which is like the standard Gnome
    Screenshot tool on steroids.</li>
<li>If you install Shutter and then hit the Print Screen button, it'll
    take a picture of your screen.</li>
<li>One of the main reasons people take screenshots of their screen is
    to show them to other people, which makes this a perfect case for
    publishing the screenshot to a URL so anyone can see it.</li>
<li>So, in Shutter (or your similar app), provide a "Publish with Ubuntu
    One" button.</li>
<li>That button should do the following:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Save the file into the user's Ubuntu One folder (just save, as
    normal)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Call the publishing API</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The publishing API will be D-Bus; I can't confirm exactly how it
    will work, yet, because the team are still constructing it, but keep
    your eyes open for more details!</li>
<li>This shows a basic principle of Ubuntu One's design; pretty much
    anything you can do explicitly, like publish a file, or share a
    file, can also be done using the D-Bus API from applications.</li>
<li>I'll answer some questions here about using Ubuntu One file sync in
    your apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>kklimonda|lernid</em> QUESTION: Is there a full GObject U1 API for
    storing data, settings etc. or do we have to make use of \~/Ubuntu
    One/ for now?</li>
<li>Data and settings are best stored in desktopcouch if you want to
    take advantage of all that lovely synchronization goodness; there
    are benefits to doing it that way, and I'll talk about desktopcouch
    in a bit.</li>
<li>But you can certainly store settings files in \~/Ubuntu One if you
    want to</li>
<li>and obviously actual data *content* that your apps work on, your
    documents and so on, are stored in \~/Ubuntu One</li>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: in 10.04 you will be allowed to have
    multiple sync folders outside of \~/Ubuntu One/ ?</li>
<li>mhall119|work, yep, you sure will. UDFs (user defined folders) are a
    big feature that'll land in 10.04.</li>
<li><em>strycore89</em> QUESTION : will we be able to share single files and
    not whole directories ?</li>
<li>No. Sharing is done folder-by-folder, and we're not planning on
    changing that.</li>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: right now the local folder names match the
    online folder names. With the ability to have multiple sync folders,
    how are naming conflicts resolved?</li>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean here by "naming conflicts"; maybe we can
    pick that point up after the session, or later on?</li>
<li><em>foobob</em> QUESTION: are you thinking of giving some GB more to the
    free plan?</li>
<li>I don't believe we are at the moment, no.</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> QUESTION: will be ready symlincs in U1?</li>
<li>yltsrc, UDFs, being able to mark any folder as Ubuntu One
    synchronized, takes the place of symlinks. If you use, er, some
    alternative to Ubuntu One and you're used to putting a symlink in,
    say, \~/SyncedFolder which points at \~/SomeOtherFolder to get
    SomeOtherFolder synced, you don't need to do that in Ubuntu One; you
    just mark SomeOtherFolder as a UDF and it will be synced for you.</li>
<li><em>lantash49</em> QUESTION: Will there be more detailed specification
    w.r.t storing settings in \~/Ubuntu One? Storing them there directly
    seems to conflict with the XDG directory specs.</li>
<li>lantash49, one obvious approach to this is to mark XDG_CONFIG_DIR
    and XDG_DATA_DIR as UDFs, so they're synchronized across your
    computers.</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> QUESTION: i want participate in testing U1, how can I do
    it?</li>
<li>Drop into #ubuntuone and talk to the team about what's going on and
    how you can help; we've had some really helpful community members
    already, like rtgz, who's done tons of stuff</li>
<li><em>taj</em> QUESTION: Are there any plans to make U1 cross-platform?</li>
<li>There's a sprint at PyCon US to port Ubuntu One file sharing to
    Windows:
    &lt;a href=" http://us.pycon.org/2010/sprints/projects/ubuntuone/" http: us.pycon.org 2010 sprints projects ubuntuone &lt; a&gt;</li>
<li>and mandel, another incredible community member, is currently
    porting desktopcouch to Windows: <a href="http://www.themacaque.com/?p=372">http://www.themacaque.com/?p=372</a></li>
<li>both of those projects are great, and if you can help that'd be
    wonderful</li>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: If I put a symlink inside of a UDF, that
    points elsewhere, does U1 sync that as a link, or as a copy of what
    is linked to?</li>
<li>it's synced as a symlink.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Desktop Couch</h3>
<ul>
<li>The second leg of Ubuntu One for developers is desktopcouch, the
    CouchDB on your desktop.</li>
<li>If you missed my last Ubuntu Developer Week talk about the basics of
    desktopcouch and what it's for, you can read it at
    <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/09/03/desktop-couch-irc-talk">http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/09/03/desktop-couch-irc-talk</a></li>
<li>In fact, you can read all the desktopcouch documentation at
    <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktopcouch/Documentation/">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktopcouch/Documentation/</a>,
    and you should do so :-)</li>
<li>The bit that's most likely to be relevant here is the "I am a
    developer, and I want the applications I write to store data in and
    work with desktopcouch" section. It contains much that is relevant
    to this talk!</li>
<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2009/12/code-tutorial-make-your-application-sync-with-ubuntu-one.ars/1">http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2009/12/code-tutorial-make-your-application-sync-with-ubuntu-one.ars/1</a>
    is a really great guide, written by segphault, of how to support
    cloud synchronization of data in your applications.</li>
<li>Essentially, if you use desktopcouch to store your application's
    data, instead of using sqlite or flat files, then the data will be
    synchronised between all your machines *without you having to do
    anything*.</li>
<li>So your app will work the same on all your machines with no effort.</li>
<li>To store a record in desktopcouch, simply do:</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from desktopcouch.records.server import CouchDatabase
        &gt;&gt;&gt; from desktopcouch.records.record import Record
        &gt;&gt;&gt; db = CouchDatabase('testing', create=True)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; r = Record({'key':'value'}, record_type='http://example.com/testrecord')
        &gt;&gt;&gt; record_id = db.put_record(r)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to get it back, by record ID:</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fetched = db.get_record(record_id)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; print fetched['key']
         'value'</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Quickly project, for writing Ubuntu apps, have created "widgets"
    that use desktopcouch without you having to think about it.
    CouchGrid, for example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from desktopcouch.records.couchgrid import CouchGrid
        &gt;&gt;&gt; keys=["key","another key"] # to label the columns
        &gt;&gt;&gt; couchgrid = CouchGrid(db_name, record_type=record_type, keys=keys)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; mywindow.pack_start(couchgrid)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>and then you have a CouchGrid, which is a data table where all the
    data is automatically retrieved from desktopcouch and stored back
    into desktopcouch when changed</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/calorielookup#p/a/u/0/Vwr5Xw5ZrIE">http://www.youtube.com/user/calorielookup#p/a/u/0/Vwr5Xw5ZrIE</a> has
    a video demonstrating couchgrids</li>
<li>You don't have to know anything about desktopcouch at all for this!
    Just use the widget and your data will be saved to the database and
    synced to your different machines with no effort or code on your
    part at all.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly/Snippets">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly/Snippets</a> has a few more examples
    of using desktopcouch from Python and from Quickly apps.</li>
<li>So, cloud-enable your apps! Let's see my song ratings in Rhythmbox
    or Banshee or Amarok or Exaile or Quod Libet appear on all of my
    machines. Let's see my Chrome bookmarks appear everywhere, like my
    Firefox bookmarks already do.</li>
<li>Remember, too, that apps can share data. If you want to store song
    ratings for Amarok in desktopcouch, don't make that storage
    Amarok-specific; that way, if I decide to switch to Quod Libet I
    don't have to re-rate all my songs!</li>
<li>I'm happy to answer questions about sharing of data between apps if
    you have them.</li>
<li>Also, I'll stop now to take some questions about desktopcouch
    generally.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>andypiper</em> QUESTION: what is Quickly....?!</li>
<li>Quickly is an app that helps you make Ubuntu apps really...quickly</li>
<li>it takes care of putting together the framework of an application
    for you, and it makes a deb package for you and uploads the code to
    launchpad, etc. All the boring stuff that you don't care about when
    you just want to get your app done</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek1001/I18NYourApp">the next session, by didrocks, is about quickly</a>, so I'd stick
    around for that :-)</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly</a> has more</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> QUESTION: is available any standard for database name? And
    how resolve conflicts with different application?</li>
<li>yltsrc, there isn't a standard, as such, for database names, because
    what the desktopcouch project is trying to avoid is laying down lots
    of standards that you Must Comply With</li>
<li>we're a "rough consensus and running code" sort of group :-)</li>
<li>the best place to have discussions about that sort of thing is at
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/desktop-couchdb">http://groups.google.com/group/desktop-couchdb</a> which is the
    desktopcouch mailing list</li>
<li>desktopcouch records are deliberately set up to have two sections, a
    "main section" and an "application specific" section</li>
<li>so the idea is that apps co-operate on the main section and store
    app-specific data in the app-specific section</li>
<li>for example, Evolution contacts sync in Ubuntu One is done by
    Evolution storing your contact data in desktopcouch</li>
<li>but the format for a contact has been defined</li>
<li>and the contacts are stored in a database in desktopcouch called
    "contacts"</li>
<li>so Thunderbird, for example, could *also* sync its contacts to
    that same database, in the same format</li>
<li>and Evolution stores Evo-specific data (like, say, an internal ID)
    for a contact record in the app-specific part of the contact record</li>
<li>and Thunderbird would do the same</li>
<li>what this means is that if you decide to switch from Evolution to
    Thunderbird, you've still got your addressbook! You don't have to
    export it and re-import it every time you move between applications</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> QUESTION: U1 require python (2.6). Is any plans to run it
    on python3?</li>
<li>I don't believe there is, at the moment, no.</li>
<li><em>b1ackcr0w</em> QUESTION: SpiderOak is said to be going Open Source
    soon, are there oppertunities to integrate their services with U1?</li>
<li>There could be, certainly. I haven't looked into that in detail
    myself, but I'll be sure and bring it up!</li>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: I want to hack on the server-part of U1,
    short of becoming a Canonical employee, what can I do?</li>
<li>At the moment, you can't, I'm afraid. The source code for the server
    part of file synchronization is closed.</li>
<li>The source code for the server part of desktopcouch is CouchDB,
    though, and work on that is perfectly doable.</li>
<li>We worked closely with the CouchDB upstream project to make sure
    that all the changes we needed to use CouchDB in Ubuntu One were
    part of the main CouchDB trunk.</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> Is avalably any FEATURE ROADMAP for U1?</li>
<li>that's...sorta what this talk is :) I can see how it might be useful
    to have a more formal statement of "what's coming up", though. I'll
    bring that up with the team.</li>
<li><em>yltsrc</em> QUESTION: is U1 uses dbus? and how i can extend my
    application to use it?</li>
<li>Yes. The syncdaemon, which is the bit that handles file
    synchronization, exposes D-Bus commands for almost everything it
    does.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web apps and desktop apps talking via Ubuntu One</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since desktopcouch is a CouchDB, and since your data is synchronised
    not only to your other machines but up to the cloud as well, this
    opens up the intriguing possibility that you can build a web app
    that can share data with your desktop app.</li>
<li>Ubuntu One's CouchDB uses OAuth for authentication.</li>
<li>This means that your web app can ask permission from the user to
    read your desktop app's CouchDB data directly from Ubuntu One.</li>
<li>So the data that appears in your desktop app can also be available
    to that user on the web.</li>
<li>This is a pretty new area, so nobody's using it yet, but it's
    possible.</li>
<li>You use OpenID to log the user in to your web app using Ubuntu One
    -- you may have seen "log in with Twitter" buttons, or "Facebook
    Connect", which work on the same principle.</li>
<li>Once that's done, your web app can then request permission to read
    the user's CouchDB database to get at the data that your *desktop*
    app stored there.</li>
<li>So, if we think about the song ratings example above, you can build
    a web application that can show all the song ratings that the user
    has entered and allow them to be edited.</li>
<li>Your users can then manage their song ratings or playlists or
    whatever else you've stored directly from a web interface if they're
    not at their actual computer.</li>
<li>Sharing data between web apps and desktop apps is quite hard, and
    not many people are doing it, so this is a chance to offer a feature
    that no-one else has!</li>
<li>DesktopCouch plus web apps give you the ability to share that data
    without you having to do any extra work.</li>
<li>This also gives you the ability to offer mobile apps as a web
    interface, so people can work with their data from their smartphone
    and see their work reflected on their desktop when they get back to
    it.</li>
<li>Are there any questions about how linking up desktop apps and web
    apps would work?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: how does it handle when a file is edited
    on2 different computers before syncing?</li>
<li>If that happens, you'll get a .u1-conflict file showing you that
    there was a conflict, for file synchronization.</li>
<li>In desktopcouch, there will be a conflict record for the data.</li>
<li>One of the things that we have on our Big List Of Stuff To Do is
    some sort of graphical conflict management to make dealing with
    these situations even easier, but that won't be done for 10.04.</li>
<li>So at the moment, handling data conflicts is done by the
    applications that use the data; the applications have a better idea
    about how to merge/overwrite/handle conflicts than Ubuntu One does
    most of the time anyway, because Ubuntu One just moves the data
    around, it doesn't always understand it.</li>
<li><em>qense</em> (late) QUESTION: When you define a UDF outside the Ubuntu
    One directory, where will it be synced to when you enable/install
    Ubuntu One on a different computer?</li>
<li>It'll be synced to the same path, so if you mark \~/myfolder as a
    UDF on computer 1, it'll appear as \~/myfolder on computer 2.</li>
<li><em>duanedesign</em> QUESTION: Where can I find documentation on the U1 API</li>
<li>the desktopcouch API is defined (mostly) in the desktopcouch
    documentation at

<li>the file sync API isn't defined anywhere yet, I don't believe,
    because we haven't had a chance to do it, so it's reading the
    source, I'm afraid. <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne</a> has some
    details, though.</li>
<li><em>emoreno</em> QUESTION: Is there any way to use a Private Cloud rather
    than U1 with the same API</li>
<li>Not at the moment. The protocol that the syncdaemon uses to talk to
    the cloud isn't secret, though, so it would be possible to implement
    a private cloud.</li>
<li><em>mhall119|work</em> QUESTION: does U1 offer any kind of versioning on
    it's data, like the ability to retrieve an older version?</li>
<li>Not at the moment, no. We've talked about that, but it isn't
    available now.</li>
<li>OK, that's a brief tour of what services Ubuntu One can bring to
    your apps. You can make the files your app uses be synchronised, you
    can publish those files publically, you can store data from your
    apps that will be available everywhere, and you can share that data
    with web applications.</li>
<li><em>nealmcb</em> QUESTION: Re the question on working on the U1 server end<ul>
<li>Elliot Murphy recently talked about your open file storage
protocol, noted his "build no silos" policy for U1, and talked about
e.g. Tomboy integration. Can you expand on the places that people
can work on servers that integrate with U1 protocols?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>desktopcouch is a CouchDB, so it can replicate data with any
    CouchDB, including other desktopcouches on your LAN -- see the
    desktopcouch-pair tool for this, in the desktopcouch-tools package
    -- and so doesn't even need a server at all</li>
<li>Tomboy notes sync was done by us implementing the Snowy API -- Snowy
    is a Django server to which you can sync your notes, designed by the
    Tomboy team, and they're looking at doing their own deployment of it</li>
<li><em>qense</em> QUESTION: Any change there will be a small collection of
    snippets showcasing webintegration of Ubuntu One?</li>
<li>if someone does that I'll love them forever.</li>
<li>I'd certainly like to, it's just finding the time :-)</li>
<li>OK, if you have other questions, feel free to ping me, or chat on
    #ubuntuone!</li>
