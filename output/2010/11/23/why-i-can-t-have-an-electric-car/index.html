			<p>I want an electric&nbsp;car.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fullychargedshow">Fully Charged</a> by Robert Llewellyn, and it&#8217;s
crystallised my desire for an electric car. I need a different car; I am
thoroughly, thoroughly sick of how much mine costs to fix when it goes
wrong, and I&#8217;m tired of my car not having things like a slot to plug my
phone&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>So, new car. And I&#8217;d love an electric car. Because they&#8217;re&nbsp;cool.</p>
<p>Now, most of the marketing and arguments for electric cars are about the
environment. &#8220;Look, they&#8217;re zero-emission! Look, petrol takes <em>this
many</em> kilowatt-hours of electricity to produce! Save a whale! Drive
electric!&#8221; And&#8230;I don&#8217;t care. The hell with the environment. I don&#8217;t
care. Maybe I should, but I don&#8217;t. I want an electric car because
they&#8217;re <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe &#8212; perhaps even <em>probably</em> &#8212; you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re cool. Fine,
no problem, move along. Buy a Gumpert Apollo. Or a Prius. I don&#8217;t want a
hybrid (don&#8217;t care about the environment,&nbsp;remember?).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about almost any of the <a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/cartech/ten-reasons-electric-cars-still-suck-we-unplug-the-ev-hype-50001411/">reasons that are given for
electric cars being rubbish</a>; don&#8217;t care about resale value, don&#8217;t
care (all that much) about purchase cost, don&#8217;t care about running
costs, and, as mentioned, don&#8217;t care about saving whales. I&#8217;m a
young<span style="color: red" title="yes yes I am sod off I am young yes I am">*</span>
technology professional with disposable income who&#8217;s interested in
electric cars because they&#8217;re cool, not a bead-wearing hippie who wants
to upgrade the <span class="caps">2CV</span> to a Prius to impress the other people in the
commune. I want one. And I can&#8217;t have one.&nbsp;Why?</p>
<p>Range. An electric car will do a hundred miles. That&#8217;s not&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the average length of a journey in the <span class="caps">UK</span> is 8 miles or
whatever. Yes, most of my drives are about 5 miles. Yes, an electric car
is perfect for these. I agree,&nbsp;entirely.</p>
<p>But I live 60 miles from my daughter, who I pick up once a fortnight,
and 120 miles from my parents, who I see once every six weeks. There is
no electric car on the market which will reliably do 120 miles when
driven normally. They&#8217;ll do 80, or 100. Or they&#8217;ll do 120 if driven
<em>really, really carefully</em>, and even then it&#8217;s doubtful. This kills the
idea stone cold dead, and it&#8217;s not gonna change in the next few years as
far as I can&nbsp;tell.</p>
<p>Sidebar 1: when I say &#8220;no electric car on the market&#8221;&#8230;there are no
electric cars on the market, right now. Leaving aside pure city cars
like the G-Wiz, which do about 40 miles and are not designed for any
sort of long journey, you can&#8217;t actually buy an electric car right now.
The Nissan Leaf isn&#8217;t out until March 2011. The <span class="caps">BMW</span> Mini-E is only in a
private trial in the south-east. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV isn&#8217;t out until
January 2011. I can&#8217;t actually buy an electric car, even if I wanted&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Sidebar 2: there <em>is</em> an electric car which has the range that I need.
The Tesla Roadster. That&#8217;ll do 245 miles on a charge, and even if Tesla
are completely full of crap about that spec it&#8217;s still way, way more
than I need. We&#8217;ll ignore that it&#8217;s left-hand-drive, we&#8217;ll ignore that
you can&#8217;t buy a <span class="caps">UK</span> one as far as I can tell, and settle on the problem:
I can&#8217;t have a Tesla because they cost ninety grand. Yes, I said above
that I don&#8217;t care about cost, but I care a bit. I don&#8217;t have 90k. I&#8217;m
not John Carmack. No Tesla for me. End of&nbsp;sidebar.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future a &#8220;fast charge&#8221; will take 10 minutes rather than 30,
and there&#8217;ll be a fast-charge station somewhere in between my house and
my parents&#8217;. Maybe in the future the <a href="http://www.betterplace.com/">Better Place</a> people will
convince car manufacturers to co-operate and build switchable batteries
and then put battery swap stations on every road. Maybe there&#8217;ll be some
huge leap forward in technology and we&#8217;ll get five times the life out of
a battery (this&#8217;ll be good for my laptop, too, I have to say). But right
now I just can&#8217;t see how I can get an electric car. The average length
of a journey is irrelevant. If you need to ever, ever drive over the
range of your electric car then your electric car&#8217;s useless, right now.
Five years from now I hope it&#8217;ll all be different. But it looks to me
like I need to get some different car and then the <em>next</em> time I change,
get an&nbsp;electric.</p>
<p>If you think I&#8217;m wrong, I&#8217;d love to hear why. Speak&nbsp;up.</p>
