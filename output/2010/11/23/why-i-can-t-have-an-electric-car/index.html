			<p>I want an electric car.</p>
<p>I've been watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fullychargedshow">Fully Charged</a> by Robert Llewellyn, and it's
crystallised my desire for an electric car. I need a different car; I am
thoroughly, thoroughly sick of how much mine costs to fix when it goes
wrong, and I'm tired of my car not having things like a slot to plug my
phone in.</p>
<p>So, new car. And I'd love an electric car. Because they're cool.</p>
<p>Now, most of the marketing and arguments for electric cars are about the
environment. "Look, they're zero-emission! Look, petrol takes <em>this
many</em> kilowatt-hours of electricity to produce! Save a whale! Drive
electric!" And...I don't care. The hell with the environment. I don't
care. Maybe I should, but I don't. I want an electric car because
they're <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe -- perhaps even <em>probably</em> -- you don't think they're cool. Fine,
no problem, move along. Buy a Gumpert Apollo. Or a Prius. I don't want a
hybrid (don't care about the environment, remember?).</p>
<p>I don't care about almost any of the <a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/cartech/ten-reasons-electric-cars-still-suck-we-unplug-the-ev-hype-50001411/">reasons that are given for
electric cars being rubbish</a>; don't care about resale value, don't
care (all that much) about purchase cost, don't care about running
costs, and, as mentioned, don't care about saving whales. I'm a
young<span style="color: red" title="yes yes I am sod off I am young yes I am">*</span>
technology professional with disposable income who's interested in
electric cars because they're cool, not a bead-wearing hippie who wants
to upgrade the 2CV to a Prius to impress the other people in the
commune. I want one. And I can't have one. Why?</p>
<p>Range. An electric car will do a hundred miles. That's not enough.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the average length of a journey in the UK is 8 miles or
whatever. Yes, most of my drives are about 5 miles. Yes, an electric car
is perfect for these. I agree, entirely.</p>
<p>But I live 60 miles from my daughter, who I pick up once a fortnight,
and 120 miles from my parents, who I see once every six weeks. There is
no electric car on the market which will reliably do 120 miles when
driven normally. They'll do 80, or 100. Or they'll do 120 if driven
<em>really, really carefully</em>, and even then it's doubtful. This kills the
idea stone cold dead, and it's not gonna change in the next few years as
far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Sidebar 1: when I say "no electric car on the market"...there are no
electric cars on the market, right now. Leaving aside pure city cars
like the G-Wiz, which do about 40 miles and are not designed for any
sort of long journey, you can't actually buy an electric car right now.
The Nissan Leaf isn't out until March 2011. The BMW Mini-E is only in a
private trial in the south-east. The Mitsubishi i-MiEV isn't out until
January 2011. I can't actually buy an electric car, even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Sidebar 2: there <em>is</em> an electric car which has the range that I need.
The Tesla Roadster. That'll do 245 miles on a charge, and even if Tesla
are completely full of crap about that spec it's still way, way more
than I need. We'll ignore that it's left-hand-drive, we'll ignore that
you can't buy a UK one as far as I can tell, and settle on the problem:
I can't have a Tesla because they cost ninety grand. Yes, I said above
that I don't care about cost, but I care a bit. I don't have 90k. I'm
not John Carmack. No Tesla for me. End of sidebar.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future a "fast charge" will take 10 minutes rather than 30,
and there'll be a fast-charge station somewhere in between my house and
my parents'. Maybe in the future the <a href="http://www.betterplace.com/">Better Place</a> people will
convince car manufacturers to co-operate and build switchable batteries
and then put battery swap stations on every road. Maybe there'll be some
huge leap forward in technology and we'll get five times the life out of
a battery (this'll be good for my laptop, too, I have to say). But right
now I just can't see how I can get an electric car. The average length
of a journey is irrelevant. If you need to ever, ever drive over the
range of your electric car then your electric car's useless, right now.
Five years from now I hope it'll all be different. But it looks to me
like I need to get some different car and then the <em>next</em> time I change,
get an electric.</p>
<p>If you think I'm wrong, I'd love to hear why. Speak up.</p>
