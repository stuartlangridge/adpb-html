		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>So, I&#8217;m getting a new phone. Here&#8217;s an insight into my decision-making&nbsp;processes.</p>
<p>I have, repeatedly and irritatedly, complained that phones now are too big. My beloved <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z5_compact-7535.php">Sony Xperia Z5 Compact</a> is the right size for a phone, in my opinion. I always, always use my phone one-handed; I never ever hold in one hand and touch the screen with the other. It is a loss to me why this, which was the normal way of using a phone for <em>years</em>, has been reclassified as a thing that nobody wants any more, but <em>c&#8217;est la vie</em>, I suppose. Anyway, said beloved <span class="caps">Z5C</span> finally threw a seven the other day and decided that it wouldn&#8217;t do wifi any more. Or, more accurately, that it was fine doing wifi when within about two feet of the router, and not&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not ideal, I&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s five years old. So I probably did <span class="caps">OK</span> out of it. And the battery life is shocking now. So I&#8217;ve been vaguely thinking about getting something new for a while. I&#8217;m not sure that the wifi thing is sensibly repairable, and I read <a href="https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z-series/Z5-compact-poor-wifi-and-bluetooth-range-after-battery-change/td-p/1220097">a forum post</a> about a chap who took his <span class="caps">Z5C</span> apart to replace the (not-user-replaceable) battery (a process which involves heating it up to break the glue behind the glass, and a bunch of other stuff that there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d be able to do without breaking the phone and possibly burning down the building) and while doing so managed to snap a tiny bit of metal which then broke the wifi antenna and made it exhibit the problems I&#8217;m seeing. So that&#8217;s probably what happened; it got jolted or something. No chance of me fixing that; if I have to solder anything, I&#8217;ll screw it up. This is the universe telling me to get a new phone, I&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>Consequently, it&#8217;s off to <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3?"><span class="caps">GSM</span> Arena&#8217;s phone finder</a>. I don&#8217;t actually have much in the way of requirements for a phone. My original list of needs&nbsp;was:</p>
<ul>
<li>not too big (for what exactly qualifies as not too big, read&nbsp;on)</li>
<li>not too expensive (flagship phones are now a thousand pounds! even non-flagship ones are £500! I don&#8217;t have a monkey just lying&nbsp;around)</li>
<li><span class="caps">NFC</span> (for Google Pay, which I use <em>all the time</em>)</li>
<li>a headphone jack (because wireless headphones are pointless and expensive and worse in every conceivable way other than &#8220;the cable doesn&#8217;t get tangled up&#8221;, and I don&#8217;t like them and don&#8217;t want to buy&nbsp;any)</li>
<li>made in the last couple of years, since if I&#8217;m spending money on a phone I want it to last a while; there&#8217;s not a lot of point replacing my 2015 <span class="caps">Z5C</span> with a phone of similar&nbsp;vintage</li>
<li>and I like pretty things. Design is important to me. <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/12/02/i-bought-an-iphone/">Beauty, vitality, and openness</a> are all&nbsp;important.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not much of a strenuous list of requirements, to be honest. Or so I thought. I did some searches, and quickly established that I&#8217;d have to get something bigger than the <span class="caps">Z5C</span>; there isn&#8217;t anything at all that size, these days. So I wandered into town with the intention of picking up some actual phones to get a sense of what was too&nbsp;big.</p>
<p>This was harder than it looks, because basically every phone shop now bolts all their phones to the table so they can&#8217;t be picked up. All you can do is jab at the screen like a bloody caveman. This is pretty goddamn annoying when the point of the test is to see what a phone feels like in the hand. The O2 shop had a bunch of plastic <em>models</em> of phones and even those had a massive thing glued on the back with a retracting wire cable in it, as if I&#8217;m going to steal a non-functional plastic box, O2, for god&#8217;s sake, stop treating your customers like criminals, this is almost as bad as hotels giving you those crap two-part hangers like I&#8217;m going to spend £150 on a night in the Premier Inn and then nick the hangers, what&#8217;s wrong with you&#8230; but it did at least let me establish that the absolute outside maximum size for a phone that I&#8217;m able to tolerate is the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s10e-9537.php">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a>. Anything bigger than that is just too big; I can&#8217;t reach the top of the screen without using my other&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>A search on gsmarena for <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;chk35mm=selected&amp;chkNFC=selected">phones less than 143mm in height, with <span class="caps">NFC</span> and 3.5mm jack, from 2018 onwards</a> lists three phones. The S10e as mentioned, the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xa2-8986.php">Sony Xperia <span class="caps">XA2</span></a>, and the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sharp_aquos_r2_compact-9406.php">Sharp Aquos R2 Compact</a>. Now, I quite like the look of the Aquos (despite all the reviews saying &#8220;it&#8217;s got two notches! not even the Nazis did that!&#8221;) but as far as I can tell it just was flat never made available in the <span class="caps">UK</span> at all; getting hold of one is hard. And the S10e, while it seems <span class="caps">OK</span>, is a Samsung (which I&#8217;m not fond of) and more importantly is £450. This left me looking at the Xperia <span class="caps">XA2</span>, which was a possibility &#8212; it&#8217;s sort of a grand-nephew of my <span class="caps">Z5C</span>. Reviews weren&#8217;t very encouraging, but I figured&#8230; this might be <span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
<p>Andrew Hutchings pointed out on Twitter (because <em>of course</em> I was bitching about this whole situation on Twitter) that <a href="https://twitter.com/LinuxJedi/status/1228647263104360449">there are <span class="caps">USB</span>-to-headphone-jack adaptors</a>. Now, I knew this &#8212; my daughter uses one to plug her headphones into her iPhone &#8212; but for some reason I hadn&#8217;t properly considered that option; I&#8217;d just assumed that no headphone jack = stupid wireless headphones. An adaptor wouldn&#8217;t be that big a deal; my headphones just get thrown in my coat pocket (I have cheapish in-ear headphones, not posh cans that go ove the ear and need a bag to carry them around in) and so I&#8217;d just leave the adaptor attached to them at all times. That wouldn&#8217;t be so&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>Taking the headphone jack requirement <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;chkNFC=selected">away from the search</a> added two more options (and a bunch of smartwatches, unhelpfully): the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz2_compact-9082.php">Sony Xperia <span class="caps">XZ2</span> Compact</a> and the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8_sirocco-9087.php">Nokia 8 Sirocco</a>. I liked the sound of the Nokia, but&#8230; not for very good reasons. My favourite ever phone from an industrial design perspective was the Nokia N9, which <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/08/03/me-and-the-nokia-n9/">I loved with a passion that was all-encompassing</a>. I like the Nokia brand; it says classy and well-thought-out and well-integrated and thoughtful and elegant. And &#8220;Sirocco&#8221; is a cool name; I like things with names. I hate that phones are just called a code number, now. So &#8220;Sirocco&#8221; is much cooler than &#8220;S10e&#8221;. None of these are good reasons, particularly the ones that revolve around my nostalgia for the Nokia brand considering that it&#8217;s been bought by some other company now. And the Sirocco only got fairly average&nbsp;reviews.</p>
<p>Ah, but then I <em>read</em> the reviews. And all the things that reviewers didn&#8217;t like, I either didn&#8217;t care about or, more worryingly yet, I completely disagreed with. &#8220;As the phone has a 16:9 screen rather than the now more popular 18:9 (or even 19:9) style, it already seems dated&#8221; says <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/8-sirocco-review">techradar</a>, for which you can just sod off. Why, why would I want a phone a foot long? That&#8217;s the opposite of what I want! So reviews that complain that it&#8217;s not tall enough (which was a <em>lot</em> of them) got discounted. Complaints that it&#8217;s using an older chipset than some of its contemporaries don&#8217;t bother me; it&#8217;s quite some newer than my current phone, after all. Apparently the camera isn&#8217;t perfect, about which I don&#8217;t care; it&#8217;s <em>got</em> a camera, so I&#8217;m good. And they all agreed on two things: it&#8217;s Android One, meaning that it&#8217;s stock Android and will get updates (which I like, since my <span class="caps">Z5C</span> is stuck on Android 7 (!)), and that it&#8217;s pretty. I like&nbsp;pretty.</p>
<p>The price tag was off-putting, though. £475 on Amazon. That&#8217;s rather too much; I&#8217;d have to save up for that, and as noted I have a phone with no wifi, so this problem needs solving sooner rather than later. I don&#8217;t mind second-hand, though, so I checked eBay and it was still £250 there, which is on the very utmost outer edge of what I can just drop on a purchase and I&#8217;d have to be really convinced of it. I don&#8217;t like buying things on the knock-knock, and I am in a 12-month can&#8217;t-leave <span class="caps">SIM</span>-only contract with Three, so the idea of getting an &#8220;upgrade&#8221; from my carrier was a no-no even if I wanted to, which I don&#8217;t (the <span class="caps">SIM</span>-only thing gives me unlimited texts and calls and <span class="caps">6GB</span> of data per month for nine quid. Not forty nine. Nine. I don&#8217;t want to lose&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>And then I checked CeX. And <a href="https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail/?id=snok8sir128gbunla&amp;categoryName=phones-android&amp;superCatName=phones&amp;title=nokia-8-sirocco-128gb-black-unlocked-a">CeX had it in stock, online, class A, for £175</a>.</p>
<p>What? A hundred and seventy-five quid for a phone which elsewhere is nearly five&nbsp;hundred?</p>
<p>So I bought it. And now it&#8217;s not in stock online any more, so I assume I have the only one they had. This means you can&#8217;t do the same. Sorry about&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s due to arrive early next week (which is the problem with buying on a Saturday). I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. I&#8217;m rather looking forward to&nbsp;it.</p>
