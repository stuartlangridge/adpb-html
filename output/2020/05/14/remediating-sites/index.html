			<p>Sometimes you'll find yourself doing a job where you need to make alterations to a web page that already exists, and where you can't change the HTML, so your job is to write some bits of JavaScript to poke at the page, add some attributes and some event handlers, maybe move some things around. This sort of thing comes up a lot with accessibility remediations, but maybe you're working with an ancient CMS where changing the templates is a no-no, or you're plugging in some after-the-fact support into a site that can't be changed without a big approval process but adding a script element is allowed. So you write a script, no worries. How do you test it?</p>
<p>Well, one way is to actually do it: we assume that the way your work will eventually be deployed is that you'll give the owners a script file, they'll upload it somehow to the site and add a script element that loads it. That's likely to be a very slow and cumbersome process, though (if it wasn't, then you wouldn't need to be fixing the site by poking it with JS, would you? you'd just fix the HTML as God intended web developers to do) and so there ought to be a better way. A potential better way is to have them add a script element that points at your script on some other server, so you can iterate on that and then eventually send over the finished version when done. But that's still pretty annoying, and it means putting that on the live server ("a 'staging' server? no, I don't think we've got one of those") and then having something in your script which only runs it if it's you testing. Alternatively, you might download the HTML for the page with Save Page As and grab all the dependencies. But that never works quite right, does it?</p>
<p>The way I do this is with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a>. Greasemonkey, or its Chrome-ish cousin <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey</a>, has been around forever, and it lets you write custom scripts which it then takes care of loading for you when you visit a specified URL. Great stuff: write your thing as a Greasemonkey script to test it and then when you're happy, send the script file to the client and you're done.</p>
<p>There is a little nuance here, though. A Greasemonkey script isn't exactly the same as a script in the page. This is partially because of browser security restrictions, and partially because GM scripts have certain magic privileged access that scripts in the page don't have. What this means is that the Greasemonkey script environment is quite sandboxed away; it doesn't have direct access to stuff in the page, and stuff in the page doesn't have direct access to it (in the early days, there were security problems where in-page script walked its way back up the object tree until it got hold of one of the magic Greasemonkey objects and then used that to do all sorts of naughty privileged things that it shouldn't have been able to, and so it all got rigorously sandboxed away to prevent that). So, if the page loads jQuery, say, and you want to use that, then you can't, because your script is in its own little world with a peephole to the page, and getting hold of in-page objects is awkward. Obviously, your remediation script can't be relying on any of these magic GM privileges (because it won't have them when it's deployed for real), so you don't intend to use them, but because GM doesn't know that, it still isolates your script away. Fortunately, there's a neat little trick to have the best of both worlds; to create the script in GM to make it easy to test and iterate, but have the script run in the context of the page so it gets the environment it expects.</p>
<p>What you do is, put all your code in a function, stringify it, and then push that string into an in-page script. Like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// ==UserScript==</span>
<span class="c1">// @name     Stuart&#39;s GM remediation script</span>
<span class="c1">// @version  1</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="cm">/* ...and above here. */</span>

<span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">script</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;script&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">script</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That's it. Your code is defined in Greasemonkey, but it's actually executed as though it were a <code>script</code> element in the page. You should basically pretend that that code doesn't exist and just write whatever you planned to inside the <code>main()</code> function. You can define other functions, add event handlers, whatever you fancy. This is a neat trick; I'm not sure if I invented it or picked it up from somewhere else years ago (and if someone knows, tell me and I'll happily link to whoever invented it), but it's really useful; you build the remediation script, doing whatever you want it to do, and then when you're happy with it, copy whatever's <em>inside</em> the <code>main()</code> function to a new file called <code>whatever.js</code> and send that to the client, and tell them: upload this to your creaky old CMS and then link to it with a <code>script</code> element. Job done. Easier for you, easier for them!</p>
