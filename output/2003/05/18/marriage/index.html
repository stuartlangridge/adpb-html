<p>Dorothea's <a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2003_05_11.html#e001699">fifth wedding anniversary</a> is next Friday, which means
that I've been <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1d8s3ck.12621nqoztns8N%40host5-99-51-22.btinternet.com">married</a> longer than her and David, which surprises me
slightly. Meanwhile, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/05/18/gon_out_backson_bisy_backson.html">Mark's got married</a> as well. Congratulations to
both of you.</p>
<p>Aside: would it be unworthy of me to mention how dodgy Mark's phrasing
sounds when taken out of context? "My ring feels very strange. I've been
twiddling with it all day and now it's chafing." What's that? It would?
Oh, I won't mention it then. :-)</p>
<p>In other news, Niamh, my daughter, has come up with a new trick, which
allows me to unleash my fearsome powers of child psychology. Most recent
example: I said, "what's this mess all over the TV screen?", and she
replied, "I don't know, I didn't put cream on it."</p>
<p>Ah-ha. That explains <em>that</em>, then. Similarly, "What's wrong with this
cake?", responded to with "It didn't go in the bin!" Again, bit of a
giveaway, there. Apart from being heartstoppingly cute to listen to, I
think that this comes about because she sees two answers to the question
"What's wrong with the TV?", one of which ("There's cream on the
screen") is a thing of reality, and the other ("I did it") is a thing of
guilt. Now, she thinks she might get into trouble for doing it, and she
doesn't want to get into trouble, so she's not going to admit to doing
it. But the first thing, that there's cream smeared on the screen,
that's just reality; lying about that would be silly, because it's
obviously true. To lie about that, you'd have to say that there was
something other than cream on the screen, or that there wasn't anything,
neither of which would be believed, so she tells the truth about it. I
don't think that the "third option" of denying all knowledge even occurs
to her: she does know about it, and can therefore either tell the truth
or directly lie: a black-and-white decision. Sort of like those puzzles
where you're told that one of the people always lies and the other
always tells the truth; you can logically work out what's going on, but
that doesn't work in life because most of what people say isn't <em>the
truth</em> or <em>the exact opposite of the truth</em> but something else. It's
interesting to watch her picking up these sorts of adult attributes like
lying in a sort of ill-formed way. Child psychology must be fascinating.</p>
