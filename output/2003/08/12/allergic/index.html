<p>I&#8217;m allergic to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>This may not surprise you. Moreover, you may think that I&#8217;m not the only
one. But I have <em>symptoms</em>.</p>
<p>This morning, I walked into work after <a href="/days/520">my holiday</a>, and within five
minutes I was covered &#8212; <em>covered</em> &#8212; with a horrible rash. Looked like
I&#8217;d been stung by a whole field of stinging nettles, repeatedly. So, I
had a chat with the first-aider at work who packed me off to casualty
(our facilities manager gave me a lift to the nearest hospital, for
which I am very grateful). This rash was the itchiest thing I have ever
known. The first-aider thought I was shivering from cold, but I wasn&#8217;t;
I was trying to not touch the inside of my clothes. Horrible feeling,
your skin being that sensitive.&nbsp;Horrible.</p>
<p>So, as I say, they sent me off to casualty. I was a bit worried by this
point; I mean, I was having this fairly pronounced reaction to
something, and it came on very fast; five minutes or so. I was half
feeling that it was just something random and so all this
lift-to-hospital stuff was overkill, and half worried I was about to
fall into anaphylactic shock and die right there. Not all that happy, in
other&nbsp;words.</p>
<p>By the time I actually got seen by a medical professional in the
hospital, a good 90 minutes after I arrived, the rash had faded
remarkably and there was no itching. It was still showing in some places
(it was <em>all over</em> me, remember?), and they diagnosed it as
<a href="http://www.studenthealth.co.uk/leaflets/Urticaria.htm">urticaria</a>. After <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=urticaria+site%3Auk&amp;btnG=Google+Search">further research</a> I have not been persuaded away
from my initial conclusions that this essentially is a medical code-word
for &#8220;some kind of allergic reaction that brings your skin out, and we
don&#8217;t know what caused&nbsp;it&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, the doctor, after the long wait, prescribed <a href="http://www.mypharmacy.co.uk/medicines/medicines/p/piriton/piriton_tablets.htm">Piriton</a>, which is a
general allergy treatment. Although I went to the hospital pharmacy, I
didn&#8217;t get the tablets there, because they&#8217;re cheaper to buy over the
counter than they are to get on prescription (despite having a welfare
state, getting a prescription carries a minimum charge of £6.30 in the
<span class="caps">UK</span>). So, eventually got home, after this big wait in hospital and so on,
at about 5.00pm. Had something to eat, and took a Piriton&nbsp;tablet.</p>
<p>And then I fell&nbsp;asleep.</p>
<p>It says on the packet, <em>may cause drowsiness</em>. It&#8217;s not kidding. I slept
from 6pm until 11pm, and then woke up because my back hurt (which
happens every night, this isn&#8217;t anything to do with the tablets) and now
here I&nbsp;am.</p>
<p>My firm swear blind that they haven&#8217;t just changed the air freshener or
has the building fumigated or something. The doctors all said that they
rarely find the cause of this sort of thing. My big worry now is, what
if it&#8217;s still there tomorrow? I mean, I&#8217;ve taken another one of the
tablets, and I&#8217;ll take another tomorrow morning (after I&#8217;ve driven to
work but before I get there, so I don&#8217;t fall asleep at the wheel and
die), but what if it&#8217;s not enough? I imagine a lot of people would be
doing somersaults at the idea of being allergic to something at work,
but I have <em>loads</em> to do. Ah well. Maybe I can take my laptop up to a
meeting room where they didn&#8217;t vacuum with Stuart-Death-Shake-n-Vac or&nbsp;whatever.</p>
