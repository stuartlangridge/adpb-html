			<!--timestamp:1046300660.0:-->
<p>I've been thinking a little about the idea of emergent behaviour in the
blogsphere, especially given recent comments concerning the spread of
memes and so forth (<a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000945.htm">Burningbird</a>, <a href="http://www.unishade.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/2003/Feb/25#deathoftheblogger">Baldur</a>).</p>
<p>Emergent behaviour is defined by the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_behaviour">Wikipï¿½a</a> as a complex behaviour
which is shown by a collective of simpler agents, where that complex
behaviour isn't defined or coded into any one of the agents, and it
can't be easily deduced from an agent. Michael Crichton uses the example
of birds flocking; no individual bird has a n instinct which says "if
this and that happens, then flock". Nor are there leader birds which the
others follow. Instead, birds know a collection of simple rules -- "stay
close to birds near you", "don't bump into other birds" -- and when you
get a lot of birds near one another, all following these rules, flocking
just happens. It's very difficult to tell from the simple rules that
flocking will occur, but it does when the birds are viewed as a group;
the behaviour <em>emerges</em> from the collective as a whole.</p>
<p>This is obviously a theory which also has relevance to the study of
social sciences, which is also partially about studying the actions of a
collective of autonomous agents, in this case people.</p>
<p>It's possible to assert, with some degree of believability, that the
propagation of memes is an emergent behaviour from a collective of
people; as Baldur notes, it doesn't just occur among webloggers but in
academe as well.</p>
<p>What I'm currently thinking about is whether the blogsphere is
susceptible to analysis in this way; sociology is obviously relevant to
study of that sphere, but sociology in general doesn't think in terms of
emergent behaviours, because it doesn't overly concern itself with
society as a group of individuals for separate study. (Possibly social
psychology does, but I don't know a lot about that.) It's possible that
the actions of webloggers can be viewed a lot more simply than the
actions of people in society in general, because if we look at
webloggers <em>qua</em> webloggers rather than viewing them as real people,
there's a distinctly smaller range of actions. For example, if Shelley
is right and there's been (or there is coming) a sea change from the
link-comment or Dear Diary styles of weblogging to more thoughtful and
considered posting, will there be new and more complex emergent
behaviours? Can we predict them? What techniques are there out there to
analyse this sort of thing? Could be a whole profitable field of
study...</p>
<p>None</p>
