<p>Looks like <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2003/02.html#L20030213t1657">Tantek&#8217;s getting a new mobile phone</a>, and along with it a
new number. Why? Why not just transfer your old&nbsp;number?</p>
<p>Well, you might find out what I did when you try and do that. I had, for
some considerable time, a pay-as-you-go-along mobile. One number. I
spent a lot of time teaching that number to people; almost as much time
as I spent whining that the <a href="http://www.reviewcentre.com/post29596.html" title="The Sagem MW930: don't buy it">Sagem <span class="caps">MW930</span></a> was lame and oh, by the way,
could I have a new one, please, you know it makes sense. On a contract,
ideally, so I didn&#8217;t run out of minutes at the end of the month, and so
calls were cheaper. Mainly, though, so I had a phone that I could
receive a call on in public without one of the two bad things happening:
the first bad thing was dying of embarrassment when people looked over.
I exaggerate slightly; it didn&#8217;t look <em>that</em> bad, I suppose; slightly
curved and an iridescentish blue &#8212; how is it best to describe that
metallic-colour-trapped-under-glass sort of look, I wonder? I imagine
that the marketing people probably refer to it as &#8220;pearlescent&#8221; or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh, yes, bad things that happened when I received a call.
The second bad thing &#8212; and <em>this</em> is the one that made me want to get
rid of the phone, ideally by smashing it down into a tiny pile of
electronics dust and shattered components with a lump hammer &#8212; was
that, when it received calls, it would sometimes turn off. Not
immediately, though, and even if it claimed that the battery was full.
Unless you ran the battery right down to the minimum by just not
charging it at all for a few days (assuming that you didn&#8217;t get a phone
call), it would never turn off randomly. If a call was accepted
properly, it wouldn&#8217;t turn off randomly. But, one time in three, when a
call came in, it would ring <em>once</em> &#8212; which is just enough time to sit
bolt upright and start fumbling in your jacket pocket, either annoying
the person sitting next to you or spilling your cup of tea in your lap
&#8212; and then go dead. Naturally, since it had turned off, you had no idea
who called. Find the phone in said jacket pocket, turn it back on, and
the battery level indicator would merrily flash its three insolent bars
at you. Smash, smash, smashsmashsmash.&nbsp;Hammer.</p>
<p>So, I got a new phone. An <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/T68/">Ericsson T68</a>, which seems to be rather
nice, although it does sometimes take a while to recognise that you&#8217;ve
pressed a button. (Remember when computers used to take ages, when they
were even slightly busy, to respond to user input, and so you&#8217;d do the
same thing a few times, only to find that all your keypresses took
effect when the machine caught up and turned it into a blistering frenzy
of wrong and potentially data-damaging activity? Just like that.) That
aside, however, I quite like it. I wanted to like it when people rang,
too, and I didn&#8217;t want to spend lots of time finding the email addresses
and phone numbers of everyone I&#8217;ve ever met to tell them about a number
change, not to mention the legions (well, er, small number) of people
who had my number in some sort of professional capacity. So, I hassled
my old mobile company (who ran the pay-as-you-go phone) to let me
transfer the number to my new (different company, contract rather than
pay-as-you-go) phone. And it all worked. I had to get something called a
<span class="caps">PAC</span> code (which might be like <span class="caps">PIN</span> number, I don&#8217;t know), and I had to do
the usual thing of running interference between the two firms (why is it
that you can&#8217;t point one big firm at another and say: sort it out and
tell me what happens? If you ever <em>try</em> that, and I have, then <em>nothing</em>
happens. Sure would be nice to have work done without having to
repeatedly kick people&#8217;s arses about it), but my number was transferred.
About the same time, we moved house. Since the move was in the same
town, I transferred the phone number from the old house to the new one,
for all the same reasons as&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>And, you know what? (I&#8217;m sure you can guess.) No-one rang. <em>No-one.</em>
Tumbleweeds blowing across the face of both mobile and landline
receivers. And everyone I chased about it, <em>everyone</em>, said: <em>well, you
moved, and we didn&#8217;t know your new number!</em> The populace has become so
inured, so expectant of poor service from conglomerates and BigCos that,
even when they pull out the stops, make a transition easy, and generally
make my life and my contacts&#8217; lives more pleasant, everyone <em>expects</em> to
have to go through pain. All the way through the number transferral
processes I was metaphorically gritting my teeth in anticipation of the
denial or the refusal or the vast administrative hoop to jump through,
and it never came. The lady at my original phone company seemed shocked
that I was so surprised at how easy the process purported (and
<em>actually</em>!) was. Your firm needs better <span class="caps">PR</span>, dear; they should be
publicising this to the high&nbsp;heavens.</p>
<p>Oh, then when the landline company put cable into the new house we
bought, on the day we moved in, their engineer drilled through my ring
main and we had to eat dinner, fish and chips still in the paper, in
darkness and surrounded by boxes while trying to block out the inward
whistling and arguments between the hapless cable guy and his
now-at-the-scene-of-the-crime boss. But we&#8217;ll ignore that. Besides, it
makes a good end to a story. I must remember&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>None</p>
