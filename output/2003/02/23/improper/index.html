<p>Aquarion dissects a "You know you're a 'proper' weblogger when..." list
in his thoughts on what it is to be a <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/journal/id/1020">Proper Person</a>. Interestingly,
the question about moving from Blogger to Movable Type completely threw
me, because pretty much all the other questions apply, in my opinion, to
the "BlogSpot" sort of weblogger rather than the "Movable Type" sort of
weblogger.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be either puzzled as to the distinction, or
getting angry in anticipation of me saying something narrow-minded and
blinkered. Alternatively, none of the above.</p>
<p>You see, I'd almost <em>define</em> what I've called a "BlogSpot"-type weblog
as one which is full of cliquey in-jokes and "What type of fruit
smoothie are you" tests and posts about award ceremonies for weblogging
and one where the concept of a ""BlogMeet" rates a capital letter. I
mean, obviously there are exceptions, and plenty of them. If your knee
is jerking in fury at this point, you're probably an exception. But it's
a style of weblog that I see much less from people who set up their own
weblogging system, whether it's MT or pMachine or b2 or whatever.</p>
<p>Naturally, however, I'm biased -- no-one comes to a discussion of how
people are categorised without bias -- because most of what I write
about is incomprehensible technical stuff. This gives me righteous
armour -- I'm writing about things that I think might improve the way
the net works, not just whether my dog was ill this morning or not.
Straw men make such <em>good</em> targets.</p>
<p>Moreover, one thing that always resonates in my head when I make
accusations from my lofty pedestal of being a "tech-weblogger" is
something that Neal Stephenson wrote in <em>Snow Crash</em>, about sexism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent
type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too
smart to be sexists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that's probably true of a lot of -isms for me, including
Blogger-ism. Maybe the divide is really between "things I like reading"
and "things I do not". However, if ever you find a weblog that you
think's interesting, and then you are surprised to see that it is
administered through Blogger or that it comes from a BlogSpot URL, then
you have the same divide in your head as I do.</p>
<p>Aquarion says, 'If that's what makes a "proper" weblog, then I think
I'll stay improper, thanks.' I think that that list is what makes a
proper <em>blog</em>, not a proper <em>weblog</em>, which is why I don't like the word
"blog". It conjures up, for me, images of all the things I mentioned
above; online tests, meaningless cliquey references, the works, which is
why I don't have a blog, and why I was pleased to see that the latest
version of Movable Type changed all references to "blogs" back to
"weblogs" in their documentation and code. I wonder why that was, if not
for misgivings like mine?</p>
<p>Maybe you agree. Maybe you disagree. Alternatively, none of the above.
But if you were just about to gleefully point out all the times I've
violated my own set of opinions above, ask yourself if hypocrisy is
really the worst sin you can think of. Compare and contrast "by their
fruits shall ye know them" with "it's the thought that counts" and work
out on which side of the fence you stand.</p>
