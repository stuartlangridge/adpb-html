<p>The other day, I was in the park, and I heard a youngish boy, in the
midst of an activity with some of his friends, shout a phrase I hadn&#8217;t
heard for years. &#8220;Me, Pete, Alex, and Chris stick.&#8221; Those of you who are
British, about my age, and male will no doubt be nodding in nostalgic
recognition. Those of you not, well, you might well know what it means
too &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure how far that particular bit of slang propagated, or
whether it was ever applicable to things other than what I&nbsp;saw.</p>
<p>What I saw was some boys playing football. What the above phrase means,
for those of you in darkness, is that the shouter, Pete, Alex and Chris
are one team, and everyone else is the other team. This differs from
just choosing those four as a team (and this is where the word <em>stick</em>
becomes important) in that if someone <em>new</em> turns up halfway through the
game to play, they will automatically be on the other team. &#8220;X, Y, and Z
stick&#8221; is short, perhaps, for &#8220;X, Y, and Z stick together against
everyone&nbsp;else&#8221;.</p>
<p>A fun game of football, as opposed to the increasingly money-burdened
and formalised professional inception of the beautiful game, is not only
one of life&#8217;s true pleasures, and something that practically everyone
who used to play it as a boy will look back on with fondness, but is
also a thing redolent with strange slang. Most of this slang is peculiar
to the boys&#8217; game because of its freewheeling and informal nature; in
particular, it&#8217;s often unreasonable to assume that there will be an even
number of total players, or sufficient players to give members of the
team fixed positions in the field. There may not even be a goal, other
than that marked out by a couple of piles of jumpers and coats. The
other two terms that leap at me from my memory when I think about this
are &#8220;rush&#8221; and &#8220;fly&#8221;, both pertaining to the&nbsp;goalkeeper.</p>
<p>You see, it&#8217;s unlikely that a bunch of lads playing will have enough
players that they can mount a reasonable attack and still leave someone
in goal the whole time; imagine 6 of them playing, which is by no means
an unreasonably low number. If you leave someone permanently in goal,
you&#8217;ve only got two players to attack with. If your attacking teammate
is marked, therefore, you are a little short of choices. (What this
actually means is that you make a glory-boy run at goal, which is
something that you do all the time <em>anyway</em>, but we&#8217;ll leave that
aside.) So, the concept of a &#8220;rush goalie&#8221; was introduced. A game played
with the &#8220;rush&#8221; rule allows the goalkeeper to essentially behave like an
attacking player the whole time. This results in all three of our
hypothetical players participating in the attack, but does mean that the
keeper has to run madly back to his own goal if the other team take
possession and begin their own attack. That&#8217;s part of the fun. A rush
goalie is never bored, and is always more tired than the rest of his
friends by the end of the game. But you do get to do <em>everything</em>:
attack, defend,&nbsp;save.</p>
<p>Interestingly, proper football rules include the rush rule; the keeper
may come out as much as he likes. You see this at the end of desperate
matches, where a team one goal behind may throw all eleven players,
including their keeper, into the opposing team&#8217;s goal area for a corner.
Keepers very rarely do come out, though, and hence, I think, it was
assumed by all of us that they could not do so under the rules (we were
none of us well versed in the minutiae of the <span class="caps">FA</span>&#8217;s Association Football
rulebook). This therefore necessitated a special rule to <em>allow</em> keepers
to do&nbsp;so.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Fly&#8221; goalie is a different beast. If you have a rush keeper, he may
come out and play, but he has to be the one who runs back. A team with
fly keeper may have anyone in goal, and change without warning or
notification. So anyone who&#8217;s in the area can be goalie and save the
ball with their hands. Technically, fly doesn&#8217;t grant rush, which means
that although anyone can be nominally in goal, someone must always
<em>actually</em> be so; one of your team must always remain in your own goal
area (but who that is can change arbitrarily). In practice, however, a
team granted fly is assumed to have been granted rush as well. Fly
goalie wasn&#8217;t awarded very much, because it gave the team with fly a big
advantage, and because it was open to abuse: when under attack, everyone
on your team essentially feels that they can use their hands when in the
area, because at that moment they&#8217;re implicitly the keeper. In extreme
circumstances, some teams would stand in the area and throw the ball to
one another, catching it in their hands, on the assumption that the
goalkeeper position was passing form one player to the next after it was
thrown and before it was caught. Some games tried to patch this up by
stating that the change of keeper had to be made explicit in some way
(normally just by shouting), but most just didn&#8217;t allow fly&nbsp;keepers.</p>
<p>Both rush and fly are agreed before a game starts, in much the same way
that house rules are agreed in a game of poker; they&#8217;re suggested by
someone and then agreed by general acclamation. One player may offer a
suggestion for teams: as above, something like &#8220;Me, Pete, Alex, and
Chris stick.&#8221; The other team may then agree, with the proviso that they
get rush. In such ways is diplomacy&nbsp;conducted.</p>
