<p>You know how I was <a href="/days/463.html">supposed</a> to be working on Vellum, right? And
thinking up a new name, the current lead candidates for which are
&#8220;Vellum Polygon&#8221; and &#8220;Vellum Palimpsest&#8221; &#8212; thanks for the suggestions,
all, by the way: I actually prefer (after Dorothea) the second (Vellum
Palimpsest), but I&#8217;m not sure I can face typing it in a lot, and it
doesn&#8217;t have namecheck recognition except to word geeks like me and
Dorothea, even if we are destined to rule the world and all you
illiterate riffraff. Anyway, right, on top of that I&#8217;m also about to
start playing with the <a href="http://oldsite.blender3d.org/gameBlenderDoc/ketsji.html">Blender3d game engine</a> for the <a href="http://mailman.lug.org.uk/pipermail/wolves/2003-March/001337.html">Bloke vs.
Bloke</a> project. I&#8217;m also trying to write a thing that lets you split
up one long mp3 of an album into its constituent tracks (not
automatically; you have to go through and set where tracks end, but it
should be nice and graphical). All fun&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>So, naturally, nature reacts to the idea of me being able to do fun
stuff by creating work for me to do that must be done first. Nature
being the bitch that she is, her green and pleasant self is inflicting
on me the thing that fills me most with&nbsp;dread.</p>
<p>Computers&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<p>You see, I hack on applications. In scripting languages. Something going
wrong with a computer at a lower level &#8212; hardware failing, kernel not
working, crashes &#8212; is about six abstraction layers below what I do, and
I am therefore completely crap at it. Recompiling a kernel is stressful
&#8212; not that I can&#8217;t do it, I just hate having to sod about at that sort
of level. I&#8217;m much like jwz in <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2000/09.html#28-sep-2000" title="jwz's DNA Lounge weblog: I've been spending my time fighting with computer bullshit as usual. I am in hell. I really need to find myself a sysadmin: some eager young college student who enjoys messing with Linux and PC hardware, because I find it... let's say, somewhat less than rewarding. I like writing software, but the install-and-configure-hardware side of things just drives me batty.">this sort of thing</a>; that&#8217;s a solved
problem. I have to recompile my kernel, because the <a href="http://www.ruault.com/Zaurus/ethernet-over-usb-howto.html">usbdnet stuff</a> to
connect to the Zaurus lets me put individual things over using <span class="caps">FTP</span> (and
I use my handy <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/ipkgput.py.html" title="ipkgput: send a file to the Zaurus">ipkgput</a> script) but locks up the whole machine if I
try and do anything larger like, say, back the fucker up with
QtopiaDesktop. Apparently there were some bugs which have now been
fixed, but I have to upgrade to 2.4.20 and repatch the kernel with
usbdnet. Which means worrying about whether the alsa stuff will work
after I&#8217;ve built the kernel, which it probably won&#8217;t. Oh, and when my
machine reboots it sometimes doesn&#8217;t start up again, because it doesn&#8217;t
think that there&#8217;s a fan plugged in to the motherboard, and so the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>
stops it booting. Even though there is not only the chip fan but a
separate fan that doesn&#8217;t <em>do</em> anything (it just sits in a hard drive
bay inside the machine, out of the way) just to try and convince it that
there is a fan plugged&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what I have to do to my machine. I found out on Wednesday
that the fan in angel, the machine that hosts kryogenix.org (and
dellah.com, and a few other things), is beginning to die. So, I need to
fix that; really, what I need is to buy a new angel, because it&#8217;s pretty
slow, which means I need a ton fifty that isn&#8217;t going on any other
projects, which I haven&#8217;t got. The fan in tara, the firewall (an
identical machine to angel) is also beginning to crap out, and if that
dies I don&#8217;t have a spare machine to put in its place, which would be a&nbsp;catastrophe.</p>
<p>And finally, spike, my wife&#8217;s machine, is almost completely fubar. It&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>Without warning. For no reason. Under both Linux and Windows. It doesn&#8217;t
seem to be reproducible, and it doesn&#8217;t happen if you just leave the
machine sitting there not doing anything. But you can&#8217;t <em>do</em> anything
(read mail, surf the web, play <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/monkey4/default.htm">Escape From Monkey Island</a>) for more
than about ten minutes without it either locking up solid or rebooting.
Oh, and then of course it has to fsck all the drives, and fsck can&#8217;t
automatically fix the problem and therefore goes into Emergency Panic
Mode and makes you log in as root and run fsck yourself (and lean on the
&#8220;y&#8221; key), which is obviously brilliant for Sam who doesn&#8217;t even know
what fsck <em>does</em>. How the hell do you troubleshoot a problem like that
without, oh, just replacing all the components in the machine, which I
can&#8217;t do on grounds of both technical ability and component shortage?
I&#8217;ve got a whiteboard with a list of about fifteen things on it that are
wrong with various computers here in Castle Langridge. Printing doesn&#8217;t
work from spike or giles. Syncing the Palm IIIx doesn&#8217;t work on spike.
<span class="caps">DHCP</span> on tara isn&#8217;t issuing the same <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses back to machines when
they&#8217;re rebooted, so the port-forward of port 22 to giles so I can ssh
in from outside doesn&#8217;t work. The mouse attached to dawn appears to be
giving up the ghost, and I haven&#8217;t got any more serial mice. On and on
and on until my head&nbsp;explodes.</p>
<p>Computers are shit. I&#8217;ve got this enormous pile of medium or incredible
difficulty stuff that I need to do, and it&#8217;s sapping my will to live.
I&#8217;ve got this Easter holiday to fix it all while I have some time to
myself, so I might be quiet for a few&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Then again, I might be very unquiet for a few days as I browse the web
and post a lot to avoid work, which is a not unreasonable estimate of
what I&#8217;m likely to do. I should get on with it now. But I think that I&#8217;m
going to have a drink and read a book for a&nbsp;bit.</p>
