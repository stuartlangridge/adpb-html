<p>I saw Revolutions. A review crammed full of spoilers, so don't read any
further if you don't want to be spoiled!</p>
<p>It was shit.</p>
<p>Not at all impressed.</p>
<p>The first part was boring and tedious bullshit (I actually fell asleep
in the cinema for a few seconds until I was nudged!), the middle part
was cliched war film bullshit, and the last part was incomprehensible
bullshit.</p>
<p>Not a favourable assessment, I think you'll agree.</p>
<p>It's possible that it's deep and meaningful and I am too stupid to
understand it. Entirely possible. But I didn't understand it. Not the
end, anyway, and not most of the film either. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it all a clever master plan by the Oracle or what?</li>
<li>When did Smith go from being a random ex-Agent who could duplicate
    himself to being such a serious threat to the whole fabric of
    existence that the machines were prepared to <em>end the war</em> just to
    be rid of him?</li>
<li>What the fuck did the little girl have to do with anything?</li>
<li>How lame was Bane, eh? "Ha haaa! I'm Smith in the real world, come
    to kick your arse, Neo! Ahaha! Oh, I'm dead." He did manage to blind
    Neo, though, which leads me to:</li>
<li>Oh no, Neo's blind, we'd better give him sight made out of fire so
    he's not blind at all! What's up with that? He already had special
    green Matrix vision; bloke must have forgotten what real colours
    look like.</li>
<li>Was there any point at all to the bit in the train station? The
    Train Man seemed to just be there to leer a bit and look menacing,
    and the Merovingian was barely even in it?</li>
<li>Why would you have Larry Fishburne on the payroll and not use him
    hardly at all? Criminal!</li>
<li>Keanu can't emote for shit, either, looking at Trinity's death
    scene.</li>
<li>The fighting was all arse! It was pretty arse in Reloaded, too,
    mind; don't know whether this was just familiarity breeding contempt
    or something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I could rant for hours about its sheer randomness. When we
watched Reloaded, everyone said that it was obviously impossible to
assess it without having seen Revolutions, because it was so obviously
half a film. Having watched Revolutions, I'm still waiting for the
second half of Reloaded, because that just wasn't it. No questions
raised by Reloaded were answered, hardly any plotlines resolved. In the
midst of Reloaded's plethora of random fight scenes and Neo superheroism
it was at least not too difficult to find really good bits (Morpheus'
speech to Zion, the car chase, the Oracle's explanation). I'm
hard-pushed to find one thing I actually liked about Revolutions.</p>
<p>Words cannot describe how completely and abjectly let-down and
disappointed I am by this.</p>
<p>Matrix Revolutions? Matrix Revulsions. Spare me the inevitable next
film.</p>
