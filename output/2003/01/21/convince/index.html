<p>I've been banging on at Sam for ages about moving her to Linux rather
than Windows, for a number of reasons; easy administration for me, not
using Windows, stability, etc, etc. Eventually she acquiesced, and I
bought a new machine and installed Debian Linux on it, dual-boot with
Windows (for playing games). KDE on the desktop, because it's all about
non-experienced users (I use <a href="http://rox.sf.net/">ROX</a> myself). So all should have been
rosy.</p>
<p>However, there was immediately a problem. Half the time, on booting, the
network card doesn't work. It's an Intel EtherExpressPro, and it's fine;
it works perfectly well when booted to Windows. The kernel detects it on
bootup fine, but when
<code title="The file that starts up networking under Debian">/etc/init.d/networking</code>
tries to start up networking, it'll just hang for a bit and then give
up. No network. It doesn't do this all the time, just sometimes.
Obviously, though, this is a showstopper. I can't work out what the
problem is at all; it works some times and not others. She was
unimpressed with this, but I made "I'll fix it" noises and she agreed to
wait.</p>
<p>Second problem: Palm Pilot. I gave her my Palm IIIx when I bought my
Zaurus, promising that it would make working out the monthly money and
whatnot a lot easier in comparison with doing it all on paper every
month. I installed KPilot for syncs. Now, I had some trouble with KPilot
back when the Palm was mine; it would sometimes hang during a sync, and
it would (often) drop the connection during a sync. I assumed that this
was because I wasn't running a proper KDE environment -- I was, sort of,
but I'd had loads of window managers installed and thought that I might
not have KDE set up right -- and that it would be better on this
machine, as it was KDE and only KDE right from the start. And, guess
what? It hangs during syncs, and sometimes it drops the connection
during a sync. Today's was the best, though. KPilot scragged the data
during a sync. It ate the data on the Pilot, causing the spreadsheet
program to crash when it opened the spreadsheet. So, I thought, I'll
just resync, with "Local overrides Pilot", and that'll put the good data
back on. Nope. And the most recent backup hasn't got the data in that
she needs. So it's completely buggered. Now, maybe you'll say that this
is my fault for not taking backups. So, tell me, what's the difference
between a backup and a sync? Why would I want to only transfer my files
to the PC <em>some</em> of the time? I expect, when I sync, that it will back
everything up. I also expect that it won't irretrievably scrag the data!</p>
<p>So she's lost that data, which took her ages to put in, and is rather
upset about it. She wants to switch back to Windows. I think I'm
inclined to agree, and I'm thoroughly pissed off that it has to be so.</p>
<p>None</p>
