<p>Happy War, Xmas is over.</p>
<p><cite>Jamie Zawinski</cite> <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2003/01.html#4-jan-2003">complains</a> about a band giving out
rolling papers branded with the band's name in his club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean really, in what parallel universe is doing something like that
ok? Don't these people watch the news? Don't they realize the kind of
bullshit crackdowns nightclubs are facing these days? The DEA claims
that glow-sticks are drug paraphernalia. I wonder what they'd think
about rolling papers? Oh, but I'm sure "it's cool, man" because they
probably said "for tobacco use only" on the back. Morons!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, wait. In what kind of parallel universe is it reasonable that a
nightclub owner might get their knickers in a twist about possession of
rolling papers? I've got some in my pocket right now, because I smoke
rollups. Blimey, that makes me a drug user, right? What happened to
fighting the power? I suppose now that drugs are the single greatest
evil in America (well, they're fighting for the gold medal position with
Iraq and terrorists and Osama Bin Laden), anything even peripherally
connected with them is a big no-no. And why is this the band's problem?
If a nightclub worries that the faintest suggestion that drugs exist is
enough to get them shut down, then it's the nightclub's job to worry
about it. Not the band. The band are giving out promotional materials;
so what if their fans decide to use them to roll spliffs? Not their
problem. If the DNA Lounge management had said, you can't do that here,
because were worried that the gummint might shut us down if someone in
here possesses some sticky paper, the band might have said, OK, you're
clearly anti-smoking fascists, but there we go,and not done it. But no,
they're just "morons". I think not.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think that Mark's <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope">posts by citation</a> thing is all
that exciting, but I seem to be in the minority. However, much like many
other things that Mark does, it's taught me something that I didn't know
(or in this case thought I knew and was wrong): I was under the
impression that the thing in a \&lt;cite&gt; tag was the text you were
citing, not the person who said it. Since, when I quote text, I tend to
make it a link to the remote site from which it's quoted, I didn't
really see the point of the cite tag. Now I know better, which is good.</p>
<p>Tantek has extensively buggered about with the underlying HTML on <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">his
weblog</a>; posts are now list entries in an unordered list. Clever. This
site is well overdue a serious makeover.</p>
<p><cite>Sarabian</cite> <a href="http://www.dellah.com/orient/2003/01/04/rss_to_nntp.shtml">talks about</a> reading RSS via NNTP. I've toyed
with this idea a bit -- I already convert mailing lists that I read into
newsgroups, and it would mean that, if I could finally find a decent
bloody client, that I could read mail, news, and weblogs all in one
place. However, I don't think that the NNTP model really matches RSS,
because the essence of Usenet news is threading; without that, you'd
have a newsgroup for each weblog with individual posts. What I'd really
like to do is sit down and plan out how I can use Trackbacks, Pingbacks,
referrer log entries, etc etc, to create a thread list for a post -- in
essence, create a References field for a given post. To do that, though,
I'd need to screen-scrape each site I was interested in (because RSS
doesn't contain referback information), and then we get back to the
"<a href="/days/000378">use XHTML for syndication</a>" debate and everyone whines about how
it's heavy on bandwidth and I'm stupid to even think that it's a
reasonable approach. So that information's inaccessible.</p>

<p>I got a DVD player and a CD burner for Christmas, so I've been exploring
the wonderful world of VCDs. I also ran into a bit of a problem with
hooking is up to my telly, because the telly is old. Ironically,
<cite>Dave Farquhar</cite> wrote about <a href="http://dfarq.homeip.net/index.php?p=950&amp;c=1">exactly this problem</a> just
after Christmas, but I ignored his advice, because my setup's slightly
different. See, most people would have a TV, with a chain of stuff
connected to that TV. I, however, have two outputs from the chain; a TV,
and a little box that rebroadcasts whatever signal you feed it, so that
you can tune another telly in the house somewhere into the box's
frequency and therefore beam, say, your video to a telly without a video
on it. Neat, huh? But if I have all my signal producers (the aerial in
the wall, the box for the cable telly, the video, the DVD player) in one
long chain, you won't be able to send one thing to one telly and a
different one to the beamer box. So it's set up like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Connections between all my video sources" src="/images/tvsetup.png"></p>
<p>The DVD doesn't connect to the TV digitally because the TV only has two
inputs; a normal RF aerial lead, and a weird little 5-pin DIN socket
(no, not a mini-DIN) with "Video" written above it. I assume that this
is whatever odd video lead standard Hitachi were pushing when they built
this telly. But the DVD only outputs composite A/V, SCART, and S-Video,
so I had to buy a (30 quid!) SCART-to-RF modulator box, and then put the
RF aerial feeds from the video (and cable and normal TV aerial) and the
DVD into an aerial splitter and <em>then</em> into the back of the telly. So
normal TV is on channels 1-5 on the TV, the video is on channel 0, the
cable telly is on channel 6, and the DVD is on channel 7. This does mean
that I can beam cable telly or a video while watching a DVD on the
telly, which is great. I can't beam DVDs, but the beaming is to the TV
in my daughter's playroom, and she hasn't got any DVDs, so that's OK.</p>
