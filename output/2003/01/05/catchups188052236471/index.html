<p>Happy War, Xmas is&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><cite>Jamie Zawinski</cite> <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2003/01.html#4-jan-2003">complains</a> about a band giving out
rolling papers branded with the band&#8217;s name in his&nbsp;club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean really, in what parallel universe is doing something like that
ok? Don&#8217;t these people watch the news? Don&#8217;t they realize the kind of
bullshit crackdowns nightclubs are facing these days? The <span class="caps">DEA</span> claims
that glow-sticks are drug paraphernalia. I wonder what they&#8217;d think
about rolling papers? Oh, but I&#8217;m sure &#8220;it&#8217;s cool, man&#8221; because they
probably said &#8220;for tobacco use only&#8221; on the back.&nbsp;Morons!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, wait. In what kind of parallel universe is it reasonable that a
nightclub owner might get their knickers in a twist about possession of
rolling papers? I&#8217;ve got some in my pocket right now, because I smoke
rollups. Blimey, that makes me a drug user, right? What happened to
fighting the power? I suppose now that drugs are the single greatest
evil in America (well, they&#8217;re fighting for the gold medal position with
Iraq and terrorists and Osama Bin Laden), anything even peripherally
connected with them is a big no-no. And why is this the band&#8217;s problem?
If a nightclub worries that the faintest suggestion that drugs exist is
enough to get them shut down, then it&#8217;s the nightclub&#8217;s job to worry
about it. Not the band. The band are giving out promotional materials;
so what if their fans decide to use them to roll spliffs? Not their
problem. If the <span class="caps">DNA</span> Lounge management had said, you can&#8217;t do that here,
because were worried that the gummint might shut us down if someone in
here possesses some sticky paper, the band might have said, <span class="caps">OK</span>, you&#8217;re
clearly anti-smoking fascists, but there we go,and not done it. But no,
they&#8217;re just &#8220;morons&#8221;. I think&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think that Mark&#8217;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope">posts by citation</a> thing is all
that exciting, but I seem to be in the minority. However, much like many
other things that Mark does, it&#8217;s taught me something that I didn&#8217;t know
(or in this case thought I knew and was wrong): I was under the
impression that the thing in a \&lt;cite> tag was the text you were
citing, not the person who said it. Since, when I quote text, I tend to
make it a link to the remote site from which it&#8217;s quoted, I didn&#8217;t
really see the point of the cite tag. Now I know better, which is&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Tantek has extensively buggered about with the underlying <span class="caps">HTML</span> on <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">his
weblog</a>; posts are now list entries in an unordered list. Clever. This
site is well overdue a serious&nbsp;makeover.</p>
<p><cite>Sarabian</cite> <a href="http://www.dellah.com/orient/2003/01/04/rss_to_nntp.shtml">talks about</a> reading <span class="caps">RSS</span> via <span class="caps">NNTP</span>. I&#8217;ve toyed
with this idea a bit &#8212; I already convert mailing lists that I read into
newsgroups, and it would mean that, if I could finally find a decent
bloody client, that I could read mail, news, and weblogs all in one
place. However, I don&#8217;t think that the <span class="caps">NNTP</span> model really matches <span class="caps">RSS</span>,
because the essence of Usenet news is threading; without that, you&#8217;d
have a newsgroup for each weblog with individual posts. What I&#8217;d really
like to do is sit down and plan out how I can use Trackbacks, Pingbacks,
referrer log entries, etc etc, to create a thread list for a post &#8212; in
essence, create a References field for a given post. To do that, though,
I&#8217;d need to screen-scrape each site I was interested in (because <span class="caps">RSS</span>
doesn&#8217;t contain referback information), and then we get back to the
&#8220;<a href="/days/000378">use <span class="caps">XHTML</span> for syndication</a>&#8221; debate and everyone whines about how
it&#8217;s heavy on bandwidth and I&#8217;m stupid to even think that it&#8217;s a
reasonable approach. So that information&#8217;s&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p>Aquarion is <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/journal/id/916">learning Python</a>. Finally.&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>I got a <span class="caps">DVD</span> player and a <span class="caps">CD</span> burner for Christmas, so I&#8217;ve been exploring
the wonderful world of VCDs. I also ran into a bit of a problem with
hooking is up to my telly, because the telly is old. Ironically,
<cite>Dave Farquhar</cite> wrote about <a href="http://dfarq.homeip.net/index.php?p=950&amp;c=1">exactly this problem</a> just
after Christmas, but I ignored his advice, because my setup&#8217;s slightly
different. See, most people would have a <span class="caps">TV</span>, with a chain of stuff
connected to that <span class="caps">TV</span>. I, however, have two outputs from the chain; a <span class="caps">TV</span>,
and a little box that rebroadcasts whatever signal you feed it, so that
you can tune another telly in the house somewhere into the box&#8217;s
frequency and therefore beam, say, your video to a telly without a video
on it. Neat, huh? But if I have all my signal producers (the aerial in
the wall, the box for the cable telly, the video, the <span class="caps">DVD</span> player) in one
long chain, you won&#8217;t be able to send one thing to one telly and a
different one to the beamer box. So it&#8217;s set up like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Connections between all my video sources" src="/images/tvsetup.png"></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">DVD</span> doesn&#8217;t connect to the <span class="caps">TV</span> digitally because the <span class="caps">TV</span> only has two
inputs; a normal <span class="caps">RF</span> aerial lead, and a weird little 5-pin <span class="caps">DIN</span> socket
(no, not a mini-<span class="caps">DIN</span>) with &#8220;Video&#8221; written above it. I assume that this
is whatever odd video lead standard Hitachi were pushing when they built
this telly. But the <span class="caps">DVD</span> only outputs composite A/V, <span class="caps">SCART</span>, and S-Video,
so I had to buy a (30 quid!) <span class="caps">SCART</span>-to-<span class="caps">RF</span> modulator box, and then put the
<span class="caps">RF</span> aerial feeds from the video (and cable and normal <span class="caps">TV</span> aerial) and the
<span class="caps">DVD</span> into an aerial splitter and <em>then</em> into the back of the telly. So
normal <span class="caps">TV</span> is on channels 1-5 on the <span class="caps">TV</span>, the video is on channel 0, the
cable telly is on channel 6, and the <span class="caps">DVD</span> is on channel 7. This does mean
that I can beam cable telly or a video while watching a <span class="caps">DVD</span> on the
telly, which is great. I can&#8217;t beam DVDs, but the beaming is to the <span class="caps">TV</span>
in my daughter&#8217;s playroom, and she hasn&#8217;t got any DVDs, so that&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
