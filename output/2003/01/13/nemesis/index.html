<!--author:sil:-->

<p>I went to see <a href="http://nemesis.startrek.com/">Star Trek: Nemesis</a>. And it wasn&#8217;t bad. You might be
thinking, this is not overly effusive praise&#8230;and you&#8217;d be right. I
have no intention of avoiding spoilers, so be careful if you&#8217;ve not yet
seen the&nbsp;film.</p>
<p>I have formulated a theory of Star Trek films. The theory is this: no
Trek film is entirely good. There are often good bits, even great bits.
But there&#8217;s always something that you don&#8217;t like at all, and you don&#8217;t
like it <em>enough</em> that it stops the film being remembered as &#8220;good&#8221; in
your mind. Therefore, no Trek film will ever be top on your list of
great films.&nbsp;Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117731">First Contact</a>: really good Borg Queen, Data,
    Picard-as-Captain-Ahab psychological bit. Ruined by the whole
    Cochrane and Lily &#8220;contemporary guys in the Star Trek universe&#8221;
    shtick. (This shtick is what comprised the whole of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092007">The Voyage Home</a>, apart from the tree-hugger bits, which is why it&#8217;s the
    worst of all the&nbsp;films).</li>
<li><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120844">Insurrection</a>: cool stretchy-skin villains, Picard being
    masterful as a captain and rebelling, etc, etc. Ruined by Picard&#8217;s
    girlfriend, who teaches him how to <strong>stop time</strong>. Never see him use
    <em>that</em> little trick again, do we?&nbsp;Lame!</li>
<li><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0111280">Generations</a>: Soran was an excellent bad guy, we got a Guinan
    origin story. Ruined by William Shatner being amazingly fat but
    still getting to ride a horse and whatnot. Bah! Mutton dressed up as
    slightly younger&nbsp;mutton.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the film that is by far the best of them all, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0084726">The Wrath of Khan</a>, is let down severely by the sheer idiocy of Kirk&#8217;s son. Didn&#8217;t
you just want to punch his teeth down his throat? I would have, if I
were James&nbsp;T.</p>
<p>Actually, if the truth is faced among us,
<acronym title="The Wrath of Khan">tWoK</acronym> is a not-very-good
film which is elevated to enduring greatness by how unbelieveably
marvellous Khan is. This goes to show what a good villain can do for
your films, even if your good guy isn&#8217;t all that great. Look at
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0096895">Batman</a>: <span class="caps">OK</span> good guy (Keaton tried hard but wasn&#8217;t given all that
much to work with), fantastic bad guy (Nicholson gets let completely off
the leash into insanity and portrays the Joker as a real out-of-control
lunatic, and obviously loves it all the time he&#8217;s doing&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>So, we come to Nemesis. Unsurprisingly, it follows the above pattern.
(Amazing, that, eh? Can I get a research grant now?) It has some great
bits. Riker and Deanna get married (finally!) and Picard does a pretty
good best man&#8217;s speech (but not as good as the one <em>my</em> best man did).
Data dies, and it&#8217;s really emotional. Someone kills the whole Romulan
Senate with this really cool rain of death weapon. But it has its big
flaw, and the big flaw is&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>The villain is <strong>lame</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. The Picard-looking guy in the trailer, who you all
thought was going to be the anti-Picard in the anti-Enterprise crew that
they&#8217;d be up against? He&#8217;s not. And he&#8217;s&nbsp;pathetic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a scene in the trailer where we see Picard say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a mirror
for you as well.&#8221; And the cool anti-Picard says, in tones of contempt,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so <em>vain</em>&#8220;. Now, that&#8217;s a pretty compelling exchange. But it
wasn&#8217;t in the film. Those lines were spoken, by those characters, in the
same scene, but not one after the other. The bit in the trailer would
have been a much better exchange than what we actually&nbsp;got.</p>
<p>Shinzon, the bad guy, for those of you who haven&#8217;t seen it yet, is a
clone of Picard, who suffered the torments of the damned throughout his
childhood in the dilithium mines of Remus, Romulus&#8217; twin planet. The
premise here is that Picard himself would be reacting exactly as Shinzon
does if he had gone through the same tortuous formative period. Now,
this idea has a lot of power behind it. We&#8217;ve seen Picard tortured by
his own perception of himself &#8212; witness Lily accusing him of being
Captain Ahab in <em>First Contact</em> &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen him brought low by
physical torture in the episode <em>Chain of Command</em> (which is the one
with the &#8220;There are four lights!&#8221; scene, but you knew that). And we&#8217;ve
seen what being confronted with a double can do for you, with Will Riker
and his transporter-created duplicate, Thomas. Shinzon has the potential
to be a really compelling, charismatic villain. He could have been
<acronym title="The Next Generation"><span class="caps">TNG</span></acronym>&#8216;s Khan. And yet how
did he come across? As a spoiled, spiteful child, lashing out at the
surrounding world in a pitiful revenge fantasy. This was a criminal
misuse of a character. It really was. Confronting Picard with the way he
could have been if the situation had been different should have shaken
the captain&#8217;s foundation of self-belief to the roots, denying his firm
conviction that he is a decent man to the core. The film tries to riff
on this theme a little, but it doesn&#8217;t succeed, because Shinzon is no
majestic villain with the power to carry it off, but instead a petty
Caligula, spiteful and&nbsp;childish.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting a bit bored with planet-destroying weapons,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>So, <em>Nemesis</em>: a film with a great potential, let down by a big flaw.
Well, it&#8217;s nice to know that Star Trek is at least&nbsp;consistent.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing. When you first saw <a href="http://talk.trekweb.com/articles/2002/07/02/1025655385.html">the poster</a> for the film
(below), did you think, that&#8217;s Morpheus from The&nbsp;Matrix?</p>
