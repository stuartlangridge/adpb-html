			<!--timestamp:1066718089.0:-->
<p>I mentioned in the previous entry that iPods are cool, but that I was
feeling "the Evil Pull Of MacOSX tempting me away from the ideologically
pure land of Free Software". <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark</a> helpfully showered me with links
to iPod-supporting Free Software. If I buy an iPod, I would certainly be
looking at that, but it's not strictly the iPod that I meant -- if I
wanted a mobile mp3 player then I'd buy an SDMedia card for my Zaurus
and use that. What I was talking about (and I didn't explain this very
well, or, indeed, at all) was the Mac itself.</p>
<p>What I <em>want</em> is for Linux to be as pretty and usable as MacOS is, which
is why I try and help with projects like <a href="http://roxos.sunsite.dk/developers/documents/">RoxOS</a>, but it's just not
there yet. And I keep thinking to myself "wouldn't it be good to buy a
Mac?" The G5 looks really pretty. Really, there are two things stopping
me. The first is expense; the last two people I know who bought
PowerBooks spent well over a thousand pounds each on them, and I don't
have a thousand spare. This is an invariant, regardless of my political
viewpoint. :) The other part is that, well, I spend a lot of my time
lobbying for Free Software and against proprietary solutions, and then
to turn around and recommend a Mac seems to me the height of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Perhaps even I'm worried that I'm using the banner of free software to
disguise a not-so-admirable hatred directed purely at Microsoft. I'm
sure I wouldn't be alone in this if I were, but I don't think I am; I
don't quite follow why I have such a high opinion of Apple despite them
being exactly the same as any other proprietary software company.</p>
<p>Neal Stephenson mentions this in <a href="http://www.spack.org/index.cgi/InTheBeginningWasTheCommandLine#head-4b55e7837d811db573ddfe548bf5e600de88e2fa">In The Beginning Was The Command
Line</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Apple engages in this sort of corporate behavior, one wants to
believe that they are really trying their best. We all want to give
Apple the benefit of the doubt, because mean old Bill Gates kicked the
crap out of them, and because they have good PR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is the truth. All I know is, I want a Mac, but I really
don't <em>want</em> to want a Mac. Perhaps this makes me stupid, or a zealot,
or something. Mac people would quite possibly sneer at me for zealotry,
for example. The most technically competent guy I know, a pretty big
noise in the Debian project (not known for its pro-proprietary-software
stance) has <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/cjwatson/19927.html" title="Sorry to use you as a bad example, Kam!">just bought a PowerBook</a> (although he's going to at least
dual-boot it). <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a>, the guy who set up our <a href="http://www.wolveslug.org.uk" title="Wolves Linux User Group">LUG</a> and a writer for
<em>Linux Format</em>, has a PowerBook and uses it all the time. What hope for
me?</p>
<p>But Macs are so <em>nice...</em></p>
<p>None</p>
