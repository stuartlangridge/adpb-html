			<!--timestamp:1064990816.0:-->
<p>Been browsing through some of <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark's</a> <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/archives/">old posts</a>, and I have
learned three things.</p>
<p>First: all Bruce Schneier's excellent <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html">Crypto-Gram newsletters</a> are on
his personal site now, not in the <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/labs.html">Counterpane Labs</a>, because the Labs
don't seem to exist in the same way any more ("With the formation of
Counterpane Internet Security Inc., Counterpane Systems has changed its
name to Counterpane Labs and no longer does outside consulting. We
continue to perform world-class research in cryptography and computer
security.") I wonder why?</p>
<p>Secondly, the <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info.php/linktoolbar">Firebird Link Toolbar</a> (the thing that gives you Next,
Previous, and Up buttons, if the site has specified where they should
point for the page you're looking at) is really, really handy. I really
must do that specification for pages here. I've just noticed how, after
browsing around Mark's site, how irrationally annoyed I'm already
getting when I <em>can't</em> step from one page to the next using the toolbar
on other people's sites. See, Mark, there is a point to all that work
you do, although I doubt your point was "make surfers hate everyone
<em>other</em> than you".</p>
<p>Thirdly, considering that the stuff I was reading was from early 2002,
around eighteen months ago, a hell of a lot of links have succumbed to
linkrot. Even from people I'd consider high in their class, like, say,
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/28/more_on_webbased_interfaces">Anil Dash</a> (not wishing to pick on Anil specifically here; that
broken link was just the straw that convinced me to write about this
particular camel's back). The links fortunately don't die completely in
most cases; instead of 404s, you get a front page or an archive page for
the site you're directed to. But <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Cool URIs don't change</a>. Personally,
I think that inventing the One True URL Scheme for your site right off
the bat, as soon as you start building, is a pretty unrealistic ivory
tower hope; I mean, maybe
<acronym title="Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web and author of the above screed about non-changing URLs">TBL</acronym>
can do it, but I sure as hell can't. What this means, I think, is that
any site that has a lot of small content, like a weblog or a news site,
will, over time, accumulate a massive forest of <code>.htaccess</code> rules or
similar that keep old links alive but allow you to deprecate them. I've
done what I am able to do here; when I moved from MT to Vellum, my IDs
for the posts changed (because I couldn't work out a good way to keep
them the same), and hence links like <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2002/09/01/aBetterTrackback">Simon's</a> to my original Pingback
idea would have broken; he linked to
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/000138.cas">http://www.kryogenix.org/days/000138.cas</a>, and the post is now at
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/80.html">http://www.kryogenix.org/days/80.html</a>. To handle this, I set up the
following rules in .htaccess for my weblog:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>rewriteengine on
rewritebase /days
rewriterule ^([0-9]+).cas$ /days/mt2v.cgi?id=$1
</code></pre></div>

<p>and <code>mt2v.cgi</code> is a Python CGI with a great big lookup list in it. I
could have just added a massive load of Alias directives or something
similar, but <code>mt2v</code> allows me to catch any old links that I missed and
show a "sorry, try the index" page. We now appear to be a lot closer to
the One True Way of URLs for permalinks to weblog posts, specifically
that specified by mpt in his <a href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/2003/05/02#a507">definition of the ultimate Weblogging
system</a>, so perhaps it is easier to specify your URLs correctly from
the outset now. But that's taken a couple of years to refine with a hell
of a lot of people working on it. In practice, if you're running any
kind of site with lots of stuff in it that isn't just static
individually created and named pages, then be prepared to build a big
set of redirects every time you redesign anything on the back end,
because you'll realise you want to change the URIs then too.</p>
<p>None</p>
