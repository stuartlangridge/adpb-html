<p>Lots
of stuff to mention, so a Mark-esque catchup post is in order. Phil
Ringnalda notes a change required to your <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002392.php">blog this page</a> MT
bookmarklet for Mozilla. I hope Ben's seen this and rolled it into the
new version. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://www.stanford.edu/~bthomas/vamp/vampecology.htm">Vampire Ecology in Sunnydale</a> (via Lots O'People): how
many vampires are there in Sunnydale, and is this a stable population?
Amazingly (and I can't believe, despite Joss' legendary attention to
detail, that he set up the populations such that there were the
appropriate numbers of humans and vampires), it all works out: a town
the size of Sunnydale can support a number of vapires which seems
reasonable, given what we've seen on <cite>Buffy the Vampire
Slayer</cite>. I am well impressed with this. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/05.html#television_days">Mark's got a TiVo</a>.
I've acquired a couple of video capture cards, so I've toyed with the
idea of essentially building my own TiVo; at the very least, I could lay
down my current video collection onto VideoCD. I have no intention of
recording to DVD, because DVD recorders are thumpingly expensive, and
blank DVDs are equally expensive, presumably at least partly because the
movie people don't want punters to be able to lay down video of their
own, especially in a world with filesharing in it. But VideoCD would do
me nicely, especially given that it's not hard to find a DVD player that
will play the format. I could also record stuff from the telly direct to
the hard drive and then either watch it later or write it to VideoCD if
I wanted to keep it. How good does a machine have to be in order to do
these things? Clearly to convert a video to VideoCD you have to be able
to grab the video input and convert it to a digital format in realtime
-- I've got no problem with laying it down to the internal hard drive as
an uncompressed format and writing a compressed CD later, but how
performant does a machine have to be to do this? <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2002/12/05/#yaml">Simon notes</a> the
existence of <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"><acronym title="YAML">YAML</acronym></a>, a non-XML-based
data transfer language much like XML-RPC's data serialisation format.
This is much like Aquarion's
<a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/nodes/view.php?name=esf"><acronym title="Epistula Syndication Format">ESF</acronym></a> in
concept. I wonder if we've all be using CSV or something if someone had
pushed it in earlier years? A <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://dynamic3.gamespy.com/~dteam/logread.php?l=oct5_2002gd.log">game design tutorial</a> which is actually
a log of an IRC session. Am I the only person who finds IRC logs really
hard to read? The black page background doesn't help either; that's so
<a href="/days/000310">1996</a>, man. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/accessibletext.html">Understanding web typography</a>, an introduction (via
<a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2002_12_01.html#e001117">Dorothea</a>): notable for some historical information on fonts, which
is a very good grounding for novices to typography (which is, er, damned
near everyone, I reckon -- there is a lot more skill in this than I
thought, although I suspect that <a href="http://www.textism.com">Dean Allen</a> could have told me that
if I'd asked), and its up-to-date-ness; I've seen too many "typography"
guides which ignore stylesheets, for example. Jonathon Delacour <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000776.html">talks
about</a> Myers-Briggs personality typing. I'm an INTP. I shall be
interested in his conclusions, although the self-selecting nature of the
sample might tend to select for some personality types over others.
Moreover, Jonathon doesn't actually reveal his own classification,
although we know that he's INxx. Those people who understand these
things could potentially guess based on his style and see if they're
right; a fun new game for all the family! Should there be a Myers-Briggs
category in FOAF, I wonder? If there were, it would reasonably quickly
because a very large potential sample population, with writings (since
they're all webloggers) against which you could gauge their personality
type. Ronaldo over at reflectivesurface <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://www.reflectivesurface.com/weblog/archives/2002/12/01/xhtml_vs_rss">sums up</a> the XHTML/RSS debate
with some thoughts of his own. A couple of minor misconceptions; RSS
discovery isn't hard with Mark's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205110000/http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=+rss+autodiscovery">RSS autodiscovery</a> LINK element, and
I'll bet money (although I have no proof of this) that the majority of
Movable Type users are not using MySQL. But these are minor points; he
stresses that "the burden of implementation is on the developer", and
gives me some food for thought on the nature of representation as
opposed to direct meaning in XHTML. Even if this conversation dies away
(which it may have done, although Tantek <a href="http://www.tantek.com/log/2002/11.html#blog20021129t0925">hints</a> at private
discussions which may lead to more), it's got a lot of people to think
about the nature of XHTML and the potential that the semantic use of
markup promises. -----</p>
