<p>So, why do people use XHTML?</p>
<p>Mark talks about the XHTML vs. RSS debate, in somewhat disparaging
terms, stating that "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021128110000/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/26.html#syndication_is_not_publication">Syndication is not Publication</a>".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire success of RSS is predicated on the principle that "you can
keep doing whatever messed up stuff you've always done on your web
pages... oh, and do this other thing too. Look, it's simple, you can
code it up in an hour with a few print statements and an escape
function." By contrast, this latest XHTML-as-syndication movement
seems to be based on the principle that "syndication is so incredibly
important that you must immediately stop whatever you're doing with
your web pages, upgrade to XHTML, validate your markup, restructure
your home page to include all and only the content you're willing to
syndicate, and by the way, would you please unlearn that ugly nasty
presentational page layout language you've been using for years and
learn this wonderful happy structured semantic markup language
instead?"<br>
 It should be obvious to any rational observer that this will go
nowhere fast. A syndication format that requires valid semantic XHTML
markup? Spare me. 9 out of 10 bloggers can't even spell XHTML.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the issues here is that 9 out of 10 bloggers can't spell RSS
either. In fact, a reasonable propertion of bloggers don't even know
what RSS <em>is</em>, or that their weblogging tool generates it for them. That
so many pages are invalid is not the fault of these 9 out of 10
bloggers, it's the fault of their tool of choice. Imagine if a
weblogging tool checked your built pages for XML well-formedness.
(Obviously this only works for <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002388.php" title="Baked pages are built statically at save time, fried pages are built on-the-fly with every request">baked</a> systems, rather than fried.)
Not validation against a DTD or anything, just well-formedness. It's not
going to solve all problems overnight, I admit, but being able to use
XHTML in pursuit of one of its major wins -- that it's XML as well, and
therefore can be parsed by the vast suite of XML tools which insist on a
minimum level of compliance (by which I mean well-formedness) and then
derive power from that (or are there, say, XPath tools for HTML 4.01
that I don't know about? -- would make life a lot easier. If your
intention, O XHTML user, is to have your pages marked up in XHTML in
pursuit of this goal, then why do you need RSS or similar formats? If
your aim is <em>not</em> to use XHTML for this purpose, what is your purpose?
Mark's "It's like...semantic and stuff" remark isn't a flappy-handed
meaningless contention on the part of XHTML pushers, it's the point of
the whole exercise.</p>
<p>He does make a good point about bandwidth, I freely admit. That,
however, reduces RSS from being the Right Thing to being an optimisation
away from correctness in order to live in the real world. RSS makes your
bandwidth bill cheaper; true. And that's quite possibly a major
motivating factor for almost everyone, because real world issues come
above principles to some extent. It doesn't make RSS <em>right</em>, though.</p>
<p>Moreover, the further points about corner cases such as Dorothea's Latin
dates are entirely valid. That backs up the core contention that
publication and syndication are not the same thing, assuming that you
actually <em>need</em> an accurate date on a post for anything. Those of you
who use RSS newsreaders, do you tend to look at "all the latest posts
from all my feeds" (in which case a date is obviously vital) or "all
feeds with new content" and then read that feed in isolation (in which
case you don't need a date at all, although the newsreader does need to
cache what it last saw to check for updates rather than caching the last
time you read a feed to see whether there are posts since -- an MD5 hash
of the feed contents is not much larger than a stored date). Quoting
Dean Allen's use of hand-crafted descriptions in RSS misses the point; I
fail to see how any hand-crafted description could be a better
description of the post than the post itself is! I'm open to correction
on this point; Mark quotes Shelley's desire to not have her whole feed
in RSS to avoid republication -- I can't see how those who would want to
republish her content couldn't just rip it off her website, so I'm
unclear on the point of this.</p>
<p>I mean, I've set explicit excerpts on posts just for my RSS feed. But
not because I think that this is a great way to summarise my message.
Because I want to use entities like &mdash; in my HTML, and it doesn't
work in RSS. I have to remember to use &quot; instead of " in all my
posts to avoid breaking my RSS feed. This is a hindrance, not the easy
path to syndication.</p>
<p>This is in danger of descending into the age old argument between
attempting to change the world to make the Right Thing the thing that
works, and stepping away from the Right Thing so that your
implementation works in the world. Pushing the former too far leads to
zealotry. Pushing the latter too far leads to Internet Explorer v 4. The
real truth is somewhere in the middle, and once again some people are
trying to decide where that line which they won't step over actually
lies.</p>
