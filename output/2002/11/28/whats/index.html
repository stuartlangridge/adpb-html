<p>So, why do people use <span class="caps">XHTML</span>?</p>
<p>Mark talks about the <span class="caps">XHTML</span> vs. <span class="caps">RSS</span> debate, in somewhat disparaging
terms, stating that &#8220;<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/26.html#syndication_is_not_publication">Syndication is not Publication</a>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire success of <span class="caps">RSS</span> is predicated on the principle that &#8220;you can
keep doing whatever messed up stuff you&#8217;ve always done on your web
pages&#8230; oh, and do this other thing too. Look, it&#8217;s simple, you can
code it up in an hour with a few print statements and an escape
function.&#8221; By contrast, this latest <span class="caps">XHTML</span>-as-syndication movement
seems to be based on the principle that &#8220;syndication is so incredibly
important that you must immediately stop whatever you&#8217;re doing with
your web pages, upgrade to <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, validate your markup, restructure
your home page to include all and only the content you&#8217;re willing to
syndicate, and by the way, would you please unlearn that ugly nasty
presentational page layout language you&#8217;ve been using for years and
learn this wonderful happy structured semantic markup language
instead?&#8221;<br />
 It should be obvious to any rational observer that this will go
nowhere fast. A syndication format that requires valid semantic <span class="caps">XHTML</span>
markup? Spare me. 9 out of 10 bloggers can&#8217;t even spell <span class="caps">XHTML</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the issues here is that 9 out of 10 bloggers can&#8217;t spell <span class="caps">RSS</span>
either. In fact, a reasonable propertion of bloggers don&#8217;t even know
what <span class="caps">RSS</span> <em>is</em>, or that their weblogging tool generates it for them. That
so many pages are invalid is not the fault of these 9 out of 10
bloggers, it&#8217;s the fault of their tool of choice. Imagine if a
weblogging tool checked your built pages for <span class="caps">XML</span> well-formedness.
(Obviously this only works for <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002388.php" title="Baked pages are built statically at save time, fried pages are built on-the-fly with every request">baked</a> systems, rather than fried.)
Not validation against a <span class="caps">DTD</span> or anything, just well-formedness. It&#8217;s not
going to solve all problems overnight, I admit, but being able to use
<span class="caps">XHTML</span> in pursuit of one of its major wins &#8212; that it&#8217;s <span class="caps">XML</span> as well, and
therefore can be parsed by the vast suite of <span class="caps">XML</span> tools which insist on a
minimum level of compliance (by which I mean well-formedness) and then
derive power from that (or are there, say, XPath tools for <span class="caps">HTML</span> 4.01
that I don&#8217;t know about? &#8212; would make life a lot easier. If your
intention, O <span class="caps">XHTML</span> user, is to have your pages marked up in <span class="caps">XHTML</span> in
pursuit of this goal, then why do you need <span class="caps">RSS</span> or similar formats? If
your aim is <em>not</em> to use <span class="caps">XHTML</span> for this purpose, what is your purpose?
Mark&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s like&#8230;semantic and stuff&#8221; remark isn&#8217;t a flappy-handed
meaningless contention on the part of <span class="caps">XHTML</span> pushers, it&#8217;s the point of
the whole&nbsp;exercise.</p>
<p>He does make a good point about bandwidth, I freely admit. That,
however, reduces <span class="caps">RSS</span> from being the Right Thing to being an optimisation
away from correctness in order to live in the real world. <span class="caps">RSS</span> makes your
bandwidth bill cheaper; true. And that&#8217;s quite possibly a major
motivating factor for almost everyone, because real world issues come
above principles to some extent. It doesn&#8217;t make <span class="caps">RSS</span> <em>right</em>,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>Moreover, the further points about corner cases such as Dorothea&#8217;s Latin
dates are entirely valid. That backs up the core contention that
publication and syndication are not the same thing, assuming that you
actually <em>need</em> an accurate date on a post for anything. Those of you
who use <span class="caps">RSS</span> newsreaders, do you tend to look at &#8220;all the latest posts
from all my feeds&#8221; (in which case a date is obviously vital) or &#8220;all
feeds with new content&#8221; and then read that feed in isolation (in which
case you don&#8217;t need a date at all, although the newsreader does need to
cache what it last saw to check for updates rather than caching the last
time you read a feed to see whether there are posts since &#8212; an <span class="caps">MD5</span> hash
of the feed contents is not much larger than a stored date). Quoting
Dean Allen&#8217;s use of hand-crafted descriptions in <span class="caps">RSS</span> misses the point; I
fail to see how any hand-crafted description could be a better
description of the post than the post itself is! I&#8217;m open to correction
on this point; Mark quotes Shelley&#8217;s desire to not have her whole feed
in <span class="caps">RSS</span> to avoid republication &#8212; I can&#8217;t see how those who would want to
republish her content couldn&#8217;t just rip it off her website, so I&#8217;m
unclear on the point of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;ve set explicit excerpts on posts just for my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed. But
not because I think that this is a great way to summarise my message.
Because I want to use entities like &mdash; in my <span class="caps">HTML</span>, and it doesn&#8217;t
work in <span class="caps">RSS</span>. I have to remember to use &quot; instead of &#8221; in all my
posts to avoid breaking my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed. This is a hindrance, not the easy
path to&nbsp;syndication.</p>
<p>This is in danger of descending into the age old argument between
attempting to change the world to make the Right Thing the thing that
works, and stepping away from the Right Thing so that your
implementation works in the world. Pushing the former too far leads to
zealotry. Pushing the latter too far leads to Internet Explorer v 4. The
real truth is somewhere in the middle, and once again some people are
trying to decide where that line which they won&#8217;t step over actually&nbsp;lies.</p>
