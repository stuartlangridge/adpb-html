<p>I've
been thinking about <a href="http://ftrain.com">Paul Ford</a>'s <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/miscellaneous_ideas.html">notes on knowledge management</a>. I
don't think I agree with Paul's assertions that "individuals solve an
enormous amount of knowledge management problems on their own", and that
"the best <acronym title="knowledge management">KM</acronym> would
observe how people actually organize data on their desktops in an
organization and allow them the same degree of flexibility with
Organizational Memory data". This isn't knowledge management, it's
knowledge micro-management. The whole field of KM is extremely
imperfectly understood, and the first guy who comes up with a decent
solution, assuming that it's possible for one to exist, will be a
millionaire. But I'm not at all convinced that the best way to handle KM
is to enlarge individuals' ad-hoc KM techniques into an
organisation-wide scheme. That's knowledge micro-management, as I say.
Now, it's possible that what Paul meant was that people <em>store</em> their
data how they like but the KM system understands everyone's storage
rationale and categorises the data correctly underneath. If that's the
case, then I think it's a good idea, except that I can't see how it will
work. I admit that I'm not convinced of the current crop of KM tools
either, since they seem to work on a principle of devising one schema
for data and making everyone stick to it, with the inevitable result
that everyone thinks it's wrong and no-one uses it properly. This is
still clearly better than the no-KM method, which involves everyone
having to understand how everyone else's personal data management
rationale works and just does not happen at all, with the result that
there's loads of knowledge out there that should be being used
effectively and isn't. Paul's solution might be a silver bullet -- store
your data how you want and the system, learns about and understands your
method, extracts the data from your storage and categorises it itself.
Ideally, it could then reflect that data back to everyone else, using
each person's individual data storage preferences; so you perceive the
system as working solely for you, when in fact it works for everyone.
Great idea. But it's a pattern recognition problem, recognising what a
bit of data is and where it belongs, and pattern matching is something
that computers are very, very bad at. The best approach to that sort of
thing that anyone's come up with so far is in things like the <a href="http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/">Insidious
Big Brother Database</a> in Emacs' mail client, where <em>every</em> bit of data
is tied up with similar bits -- an email address can lead you to other
mails from that person, or other people from that mail domain; a subject
can lead you to other mails in that mail thread, or other messages
sharing keywords with this one. Essentially, you present a user with
<em>all</em> the information and then let <em>them</em> sort through it to find what
they need, because people are very good at pattern matching. This is the
approach that KM seems to be heading for; you leach all the information
out of someone's head and then drop it into a massive data warehouse,
and then categorise the data according to a given data schema. It may
not be the right approach, but I don't think that Paul's approach, while
initially more tempting, is possible given current technology -- and a
poor implementation of it would be worse than no implementation, because
a bad KM system gets in everyone's way and makes you jump through hoops
to accommodate it. The ideal KM system would be one that users didn't
even know about; it quietly grabs and categorises data and makes it
available, all without you knowing that it's there. Paul's method is a
step toward that ideal, but it's not a doable step. -----</p>
