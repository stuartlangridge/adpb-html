		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>In accordance with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.dellah.com/orient/2002/08/01/comments_xmlitised.shtml">prophecy</a>, I haven't been updating because I'm
working on something. A couple of things, actually; one is paid work and
must be done, and the other is a little private project of mine and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.dellah.com/">Sarabian</a>'s. So, sorry for the lack of stuff, and here's a Mark-esque
catchup. I always feel, when doing this sort of thing, that it's so
old-hat -- a list of links with very little commentary, that's what
weblogging was in the last <em>millennium</em>, man. Not that I like the whole
word "weblogging" (or "blogging"), but yeah. Anyway. On with the links.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blanu.net/curious_yellow.html">Curious Yellow</a>, a network-aware coordinated "superworm".
    Interesting. I wrote <a href="/writings/tech/the-perfect-worm.cas" title="The Perfect Worm">an essay</a> a while back about how worms
    should co-operate with other instances of themselves, but this is a
    layer of evolution beyond that</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smalltime.com/dictator.html">Guess the Dictator</a> and/or Television Sit-Com Character. ASks
    yes/no questions and tries to guess your choice, and if it gets it
    wrong asks for who it was and adds that information to its database
    so it'll be right next time. It's played about eight million times
    and is right two-thirds of the time, which is pretty reasonable.</li>
<li>I'd forgotten how much I like <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/">Bob Cringely</a>'s articles. In <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20020711.html">A Hollywood Ending</a>, he says, "Microsoft has more cash on hand than
    the total combined profits of all movie studios and broadcast and
    cable networks for the last decade. So why should Microsoft care
    about movie studios? Frankly, they don't. It's just a reason to give
    to people like me, and one to be believed by people like you." I
    noted someone else mentioning this <a href="/days/000325.cas">a few days ago</a>. Not gonna
    happen, but it's an interesting thought, isn't it? Would the RIAA be
    better if run by MS, who don't care about music piracy but do care
    about you buying their OS forever and about control through DRM.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.livinglogic.de/Python/xist/">XIST</a> "is an XML based extensible HTML generator written in
    Python. XIST is also a DOM parser (built on top of SAX2) with a very
    simple and pythonesque tree API." One to look at.</li>
<li>The great <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html">Zeldman</a> redesign continues. I don't like the teal,
    myself. Or the text, which never seems very readable to me, although
    that could be a font problem at my end.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sys-con.com/xml/articleprint.cfm?id=513">Office 11 XML</a>. Be interesting to see how much of this is
    marketing BS and buzzword compliance. As Kam and I once discussed,
    you can get an existing binary Word document and put \&lt;worddoc&gt; and
    \&lt;/worddoc&gt; tags around it, and it's XML. Not useful, though. If
    you want my opinion of how it'll go, I'd say that the industry press
    will wibble about the power it gives you, a few people will get into
    it, a lot of people will try and write tools that exploit it and
    then find that they haven't got <em>quite</em> enough information about the
    format or the data stored therein to do what they want, and
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/">Dorothea Salo</a> (and others, but I'll see CavLec first and follow
    Dorothea's links) will be disappointed that MS could have done it
    right and ensured interoperability and document existence in
    perpetuum (in aeternam? not sure) and failed to do so out of
    short-sightedness.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.quicktopic.com/17/H/2PJzsGkTbtZR">Blogger hax0red</a>. Oops.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.googlism.com/">Googlism</a> tells you who a person is, by, I think, searching
    Google for "X is" and then displaying up to 10 words of an excerpt
    beginning with that. So, as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021027110000/http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2002/10/26/2300">Adrian says</a>, searching for "Adrian
    Holovaty" returns "adrian holovaty is assistant database editor and
    product developer at the atlanta journal", which is true. Good show.
    I tried "Aquarion", to see how the man was regarded (and because
    things like this aren't good at finding me because I don't use my
    name much), and got a really interesting diagnosis, the best bit of
    which, after "aquarion is a bhc company affiliate" and "aquarion is
    the largest investor", and some true things too, was "Aquarion is on
    irc". Cracked me up, that :) Just in case he objects to this, I note
    that "aquarion is wonderful", too, just like Googlism says, and on
    Wednesday I'll try and remember to bring his CD back to him.</li>
<li>Mozilla does <a href="http://daniel.glazman.free.fr/weblog/archived/2002_10_20_glazblogarc.html#83291371">small screen rendering</a> without any special effort,
    unlike Opera.</li>
