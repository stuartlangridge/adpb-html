<p>Scott
Andrew LePera (welcome back, Scott!) <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/weblog/2002_09#a000411">rants about yellowjackets</a>, so,
this being a truly noble subject, I thought I'd join in. Now, anyone who
knows me will tell you that I'm terrified of wasps. Not just that I
dislike them, or that they irritate me, or that I don't like them flying
around. <em>Terrified</em>. When I see wasps I run away. I once spent a whole
lunch break hiding in my car because one chased me. I hate them, the
horrible little stripey bundles of malevolence. Scott points out, quite
accurately, that they don't sting to defend the hive, or if they feel
threatened; they just sting. For fun. Because there's nothing good on
telly. To watch your face. And they have this mind-numbing droning buzz,
which doesn't sound scary until you hear it around your face. Especially
when everyone around you says something like, "Don't swat at it, you'll
make it angry." It's <em>already</em> angry. Wasps are <em>born</em> angry, and they
never get any happier. And they serve no purpose other than to sting and
be nasty; bees pollinate flowers and make honey and all that. What do
wasps do? Sting people. That's <em>it</em>. They're like some evil equivalent
of the Jewish <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Plains/6181/HebglossTz.html" title="Hebrew Glossary: Tz">tzaddikim</a>, the 36 righteous people on who the weight
of the world rests; wasps embody evil in all its forms and are the
representatives of the Prince of Pain on earth. You might think that
this is an overstatement, but you'd be wrong. Someone I know once, in an
over-reaction typical of him, threatened to tie me down to the floor in
mid-summer and pour honey on my face. Just the thought of this scares me
so much that it leaves me breathless. I woke up sweating in more than
one nightmare, hearing the menacing drone, feeling them crawling over my
eyelids. Rentokil were called out, a couple of years ago, to a house
where it was believed that there was a wasp nest in the attic. When they
arrived, they found that the nest was ten feet long and probably
contained about half a million wasps, or some other massively
unimaginable figure of wasps in one place. They evacutated the house for
two days. Personally, I'd have burned the house to the ground, although
that might have just left you with a pile of ash and half a million very
hot and very very angry wasps, which wouldn't surprise me in the
slightest. The BBC had a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1872694.stm" title="BBC News: man assaults car-sized wasp nest">news article</a> about a man who poured
insecticide into a wasp nest the size of a car while suspended from a
helicopter, which is an act of either colossal bravery or abject
stupidity. I don't know if Scott will actually perform his planned
guerrilla raid on their nest, but I hope he does. Every wasp that dies
makes the world a slightly better place. -----</p>
