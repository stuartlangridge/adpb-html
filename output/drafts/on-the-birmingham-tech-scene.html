		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>A certain amount of kerfuffle over the last couple of days in the half of the Birmingham tech scene that I tend to inhabit, over <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/birmingham-tech-week-founder-determine-17721491">an article in Business Live</a> about Birmingham Tech Week, a new organisation in the city which ran <a href="https://birminghamtechweek.com/btw-events/">a pretty successful set of events</a> at the back end of last year.[ref]That link describes the 2019 Birmingham tech week at time of writing in February 2020. I do not know whether they&#8217;ll keep the 2019 schedule around (and I hope they do and don&#8217;t just overwrite&nbsp;it).[/ref]</p>
<p>I think what got people&#8217;s backs up was the following from <span class="caps">BTW</span> organiser <a href="https://twitter.com/yiannismaos/">Yiannis Maos</a>, quoted in the&nbsp;article:</p>
<blockquote>I saw an opportunity borne out of the frustration that Birmingham didn&#8217;t really have a tech scene, or at least not one that collaborated very much.</blockquote>

<p>You see, it doesn&#8217;t appear that the Tech Week team did much in the way of actually trying to find out whether there <em>was</em> a tech scene before declaring that there probably wasn&#8217;t one. If they had then they&#8217;d have probably discovered the <a href="https://calendar.birmingham.io">Birmingham.io calendar</a> which contains all the stuff that&#8217;s going on, and is easy to <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;src=movdt8poi0t3gfedfd80u1kcak@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London">subscribe to via Google calendar</a>. They&#8217;d probably have spoken to the existing language-specific meetups in the city before doing their own ones without even contacting them. They&#8217;d have probably discovered the Brum tech Slack which has 800-odd people in it, or[ref]to quote <a href="https://twitter.com/SecondeJ/status/1229331926168764416">Jim</a>[/ref] <a href="https://twitter.com/CovHack">CovHack</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/HackTheMidlands">HackTheMidlands</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/FusionMeetup">FusionMeetup</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/devopsdays">devopsdays</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeYourFuture_">CodeYourFuture_</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/yougotthisconf">yougotthisconf</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/techwednesday">Tech Wednesday</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/djangogirlsbrum">Django Girls</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/owaspbirmingham"><span class="caps">OWASP</span></a> or any one of a hundred other things that are going on every&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>You see, Birmingham, as anyone who&#8217;s decided to be here knows, is a bit special. A person involved in tech in Birmingham is pretty likely to be able to get a similar job in London, and yet they haven&#8217;t done so. Why is that? Because Brum&#8217;s different. Things are less frantic, here, is why. We&#8217;re all in this together. London may have kings and queens: we&#8217;re the city of a <em>thousand</em> different trades, all on the same level, all working hand in hand. All collaborating. It&#8217;s a grass roots thing, you see. Nobody&#8217;s in&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>I think of the tech scene in my city like a night out dancing. You go out for the evening to have a dance, to have fun. Show up on your own or with a partner or with a group, and then all get out there on the floor together and throw some shapes; be there for one minute or the whole night, nobody minds. And nobody&#8217;s directing it. Nobody <em>wins</em> a dance. If someone tries to <em>tell</em> everyone how to dance it stops being&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>And so there&#8217;s a certain amount of resistance, on my side of the fence, to kingmakers. To people who look at the scene, all working together happily, and then say: you people need organising for your own good, because there needs to be someone in charge here. There needs to be <em>hierarchy</em>, otherwise how will journalists know who to ask for opinions? It&#8217;s difficult to understand an organisation which doesn&#8217;t have any organisation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates#Culture"><span class="caps">W. L.</span> Gore</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia_(clothing)">Patagonia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation">Valve</a> are companies that work a similar way, without direct hierarchy, in a way that the management theorist Frédéric Laloux calls a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation">&#8220;teal organisation&#8221;</a>, and they baffle people the world over too; half the managers and consultants in the world look at them and say, but that can&#8217;t work, if you don&#8217;t have bosses, nobody will do anything. But it works for them. And it seems to me to be a peculiarly Brum approach to things. If we were in this for the fame and the glory we&#8217;d have gone down to London where everyone&#8217;s terribly serious and in a rush all the time. Everyone works with everyone else; BrumPHP talks about BrumJS, Fusion talks about School of Code. That&#8217;s&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
<p>Yiannis Maos goes on to say &#8220;I guess we weren&#8217;t really banging the drum about some of the successes Birmingham had seen in regards to tech.&#8221; And this is right, or, more accurately, I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m personally mostly interested in the tech scene in the city being good for people in the city, not about exhibiting it to others&#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean that that shouldn&#8217;t be done. <a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/">Silicon Canal</a> already do some of that, but having more of it can&#8217;t be bad. We all want more stuff to happen, there just doesn&#8217;t need to be one thing which attempts to subsume any of the others. Birmingham Tech Week&#8217;s a great idea. I&#8217;d love to see it happen&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>And, to be clear, this is not an attempt to rag on them. I don&#8217;t know Yiannis myself, but I&#8217;ve been told by people whose opinions I value and who <em>do</em> know him that he&#8217;s not intending to be a kingmaker; that what he&#8217;s looking to do is to elevate what&#8217;s already going on and add to it. That&#8217;s fantastic. I contacted them when they set up their own events listing and asked people to contribute to theirs specifically and I said, hey, you know there already is one of those, right? If you use that (as <a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/events/">Silicon Canal do</a>) and ask people to contribute to that, then we all win, because everyone uses it as the single source and we don&#8217;t have fifteen incomplete calendars. And they said, hey, we didn&#8217;t know that, soz, but we&#8217;ll certainly do that from now on, and indeed they have done so, <a href="https://twitter.com/BirminghamTech/status/1227538112961708032">recommending to event organisers</a> that they add their stuff to the existing calendar, and that&#8217;s brilliant. That&#8217;s collaboration. So I really hope that the newspaper article kinda misquoted them and Birmingham Tech Week are here to be part of all the stuff that&#8217;s already going on in Brum, alongside everyone else. More opportunities for everyone, after all. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about, in all the thousand tech trades we&#8217;re in. Welcome to the city. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re&nbsp;here.</p>
