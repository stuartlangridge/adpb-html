		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I have a reasonably large collection of music and movies. In my lounge,
there's a big computer with a 1TB drive in it, which is where all the
movies and music live. It's running MythTV, and plugged into the
television. Upstairs, there's a second MythTV box, a front-end only,
which I use for watching TV in bed. My laptop runs Banshee, and can see
the music and films through gvfs and SSH to the main MythTV box. This
all works fine. But it's annoying. I don't really like MythTV's
interface much. Creating playlists in Banshee is great and easy, but
those playlists don't appear in MythTV. I have to import new music
twice, once into Banshee and once into Myth. I want to be able to do it
all from one place, and have it all work. So: what should I do? I'm
happy to change almost everything about the setup, with the one
hard-and-fast requirement that every component needs to run on Ubuntu,
and I'd much rather run stuff that's <em>packaged</em> for Ubuntu. I'd prefer
to use Gnome apps and GStreamer apps where possible, but if I have to
step away from that I'll think about it. I've had various thoughts about
this; I don't know whether any of these are realistic, and I'd happily
hear your thoughts on any of these or on anything else that I haven't
mentioned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make MythTV a UPnP server, keep Myth on the main machine and the
    upstairs frontend, and use a UPnP client on my laptop. Flaws with
    this: I don't know whether UPnP does playlists, I don't know whether
    you can <em>edit</em> a playlist over UPnP, Banshee doesn't have UPnP
    support afaik, Rhythmbox does but doesn't play videos.</li>
<li>Investigate the mythtv:// source in GStreamer and build a Banshee
    plugin for it. Downside: I'm not very good with Mono stuff, so
    writing a Banshee plugin is hard. Rhythmbox would be easier (I'm
    fine with Python), but again, Rhythmbox doesn't do videos</li>
<li>Use Elisa on the server instead of MythTV. Flaws: not sure how this
    helps the edit-playlists-on-my-laptop problem; see above issues
    about UPnP; Elisa doesn't actually work very well, or it didn't last
    time I tried it (it was very slow, and the UI is slickish but
    doesn't actually seem much <em>easier</em> than Myth); Elisa doesn't record
    stuff off DVB (although I could keep mythbackend running, but how
    would I configure it?)</li>
<li>something else I haven't thought of</li>
</ol>
<p>Lazyweb, tell me what to do...</p>
