		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m the world&#8217;s biggest Top Gear fan. Really. I&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2008/11/24/14-minutes-12-seconds-of-fame-to-go">see it be
filmed</a> (and literally (<a href="http://twitter.com/sil/status/1013674225">bought the t-shirt</a>). I was ecstatically
happy when <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2007/01/19/lugradio-like-top-gear">LugRadio was compared to it</a>. I built an <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/TopGearSurvey/tgs.html">easy access
version of the 2005 car survey</a>. When people say: that Clarkson&#8217;s a
smug git, or they complain that the show&#8217;s all about supercars, or that
it glorifies speed, then I justify it to them. Because it&#8217;s brilliance.
It is, quite simply, the only television programme I watch. Tonight&#8217;s
show, the last episode of season 13, was in parts excellent. I laughed
out loud a few times just hearing them talk. But, in a few places, it
felt contrived. The segment where <span class="caps">JC</span> and James made an advert felt like
scripted comedy, and not all that good scripted comedy either. Now, I
know that a fair amount of <span class="caps">TG</span> is scripted, and I have no problem with
it. The art that they&#8217;re masters of is scripting stuff that <em>doesn&#8217;t
sound scripted</em>. I&#8217;ve been in hysterics at the news before now,
especially the wizard&#8217;s sleeve joke. Or the carpets being nice in new
Astons. And it&#8217;s not just the news &#8212; take the &#8220;back to the studio&#8221;
thing, or Jeremy&#8217;s test of a Fiesta and the Corvette chase, or Car
Sauna. It&#8217;s genius. But the things which look overtly scripted &#8212;
tonight&#8217;s &#8220;make an ad&#8221; segment, setting the caravan on fire, even
tonight&#8217;s Cool Wall segment with Hammond on the elevated platform &#8212;
seem laboured and painful. And that makes me sad. Because I love the
show. I&#8217;ve loved parts of this series as much as I&#8217;ve loved any of the
others &#8212; the great train race, the Usain Bolt interview. I actually
found myself thinking, for the first time ever: are they running out of
ideas? If I may be permitted to make a comment which is like comparing
the last piss I had to the wide, wide expanse of the whole Atlantic,
this is why <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2008/06/30/the-end-of-lugradio">we stopped doing LugRadio</a>, our fortnightly radio show.
We felt we&#8217;d reached a point where we were having to strain to find new
ideas. So we stopped doing it. So I&#8217;m sitting there, thinking: has Top
Gear, my favourite programme in all of television history ever, the only
programme I&#8217;ve really been dedicated to in 33 years (except Rainbow when
I was about 4, according to my mum, but leave that aside), has Top Gear
jumped the shark? And then the last segment played. Jeremy, driving the
new V12 Aston Martin Vantage. He spoke very little initially, other than
to say that the car was sublimely wonderful; the backdrop was the roar
of the engine and images of it flashing past that were impressive
looking even for Top Gear&#8217;s absurdly high standard of cinematography.
And then he spoke about how cars like that are ending, how their day may
have passed in a world that cares about economy over enjoyment and
safety over frolics. It was an achingly poignant declaration, a
swan-song for the supercar, for everything that makes Top Gear what it
is. The V12 bellow continued as the credits rolled over more shots of
the Aston eating up a winding country road. And I thought: is this the
end for Top Gear as well? Have they been thinking: we&#8217;re running out of
ideas? Did I just hear a eulogy for the programme that&#8217;s built around
the beauty of the car, a beauty that Jeremy&#8217;s just said is itself coming
to a forced and bitter end? Maybe I did, or maybe I&#8217;m reading too much
into it. If they are coming back, I hope, I really hope, that they don&#8217;t
feel tired of the show. I hope they can keep up the level of creativity
and beauty and energy that makes it the best thing on television. It was
incredibly, incredibly hard to stop doing LugRadio, but we looked at
ourselves and thought: we don&#8217;t want to force ourselves to keep doing
this and have people say &#8220;I wish they&#8217;d stopped before that one last
season&#8221;. If the Top Gear team do feel like that and they do want to
stop, then I raise a glass to them for making me happy for 13 series.
More than one glass, actually. Guys, if you&#8217;re coming back, I hope
you&#8217;re great. If you&#8217;re winding up, thankyou, thankyou for&nbsp;everything.</p>
