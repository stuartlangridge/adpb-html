			<p>In the "stupid experiments" category... If you've got nothing better to
do for three hours in an evening, why not experiment a bit with SVG?
That's what I thought, earlier on this evening. So: <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/random/cave.svg">cave.svg</a>, a game
for people with no graphics criticism ability and only one finger. One
single SVG file, with all the controlling JavaScript therein. Inspired
by <a href="http://www.sfcave.com/">SFCave</a>, a game I played a million jillion years ago on a Palm
IIIx and which I was astounded to discover has a website and a Java
version and everything. I have discovered the following things about SVG
this evening.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is dog slow. I mean, <em>slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow</em>.
    You've-finished-the-exam-and-there's-still-an-hour-to-go slow.
    Sitting in a traffic jam for three hours and the kids keep asking
    for an ice cream slow.</li>
<li>It works in Firefox and Opera. I've tested in Midori, which is a
    WebKit browser, and it seems to work there too except that the fonts
    display as black-on-black, which means that either (a) Midori
    misimplents the spec (10% chance) or (b) I'm doing something wrong
    (90% chance). It's probably broken the same way in Safari too, but
    the game seems to work.</li>
<li>You have to care about XML at inopportune moments. I spent twenty
    minutes trying to work out why <code>createElement</code> didn't work before
    sighing and using <code>createElementNS</code>.</li>
<li>You can specify all the sizes in percentages! So it works at any
    size at all and the browser handles it all for you! Resize the game
    while you're playing and it all still carries on working and scales
    for you! Do <em>that</em> with canvas!</li>
<li>The previous point appears to be the only thing where SVG scores
    over canvas. For everything else using SVG on the web seems rather
    like having your scrotum gently resting between a pit bull's teeth.
    It makes everything slightly more awkward than it ought to be... and
    any moment now you know the pain is coming.</li>
<li>Did I mention slow? Can somebody please tell me what kind of a world
    we live in where my dual-core 2x2GHz PC can't render a screen made
    out of rectangles at more than 10fps without dropping keypress
    events? I mean, come on.</li>
<li>It's not very optimised code (but it shouldn't need to be). It would
    probably be a lot faster if I actually did things an SVGish way, by
    which I mean use the <code>transform</code> attribute and so on, but there are
    so many things I'd rather do than matrix arithmetic that it's not
    even funny. Up to and including eating a pound of fish fingers with
    broken glass in.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my head for a while has been a slight disappointment that everyone
writing games or graphics things using JavaScript has gone for canvas
(which is one step away from being a plugin -- it gives you a white box
and you draw in it) rather than the more web-ish SVG (which works like
HTML and can be intermixed and everything). I am no longer disappointed.
People don't avoid dynamic SVG on the web because they're wrong. People
avoid dynamic SVG on the web because it's quite shit.</p>
