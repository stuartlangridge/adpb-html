			<p>What the fuck? I leave the country for three weeks and while I'm gone we
turn into the bloody Soviet Union? <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/11/20/britains-new-interne.html">BoingBoing: Britain's new Internet law -- as bad as everyone's been saying, and worse. Much, much worse.</a>
In short, Lord Mandelson has proposed a law under which if you are
accused of copyright infringement three times, you get cut off from the
internet. Not convicted of it. Not even tried for it. Just accused.
Peter Mandelson, I think you might have infringed copyright. Peter
Mandelson, I think you might have infringed copyright. Peter Mandelson,
I think you might have infringed copyright. That should make it more
difficult for him to send people emails. <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/11/imbeciles.html">Charlie Stross has more</a>:
"Want to write a casual game for the iPhone and sell it for 99 pence?
Good luck with that — first you'll have to cough up £50,000 to get it
certified as child-friendly by the BBFC." <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2009/11/22/the-disconnection/">Gary Fleming writes</a>:
"Think about that for a second: the accuser gets to blame anyone they
like and with no evidence of copyright infringement, have a punishment
inflicted upon them." <a href="http://blog.geeklawyer.org/2009/11/three-strikes-and-youre-out">Geeklawyer says</a>: "The con­se­quences can be
severe. In Fin­land Inter­net access is now a civic right. For many the
Inter­net is as impor­tant a house­hold ser­vice as elec­tric­ity or
san­i­ta­tion: Geeklawyer often strongly con­sid­ers what the broad­band
is like when decid­ing where to live. If a family’s kids down­load MP3s
the whole house­hold will be blocked from Inter­net access. Col­lec­tive
pun­ish­ment. All of this is based on no proven harm, at least none
apart from the Music and film Indus­tries telling us that the sky is
falling down. To call this a dis­pro­por­tion­ate and draconian response
is almost under­stat­ing it." Now, I spend half my life on the internet,
so I might be seen as biased here. But it's increasingly a vital tool
for the modern world. Cutting off someone's net access for misuse of it
is broadly like cutting off someone's hands because they used them to
commit a crime. The very punishment is grotesquely unfair. Add to that
the points about how a filesharer's daughter now can't use the internet
to help with her homework, and then crown that with the fucking
cherry-on-top that all it takes is <em>accusations</em> of misuse, not proof,
and suddenly we're the USSR. This is not a promising development. I half
wonder whether this is deliberately the most draconian and invasive
Internet usage law outside Communist China just so that they can bring
in a law which will look minimal by comparison but is still a ghastly
violation of whatever rights we have left. <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/index.htm">Do it online when you deal
with government</a>, says direct.gov.uk. Unless someone else in your
house has sent three mp3s to their friends, in which case you are shit
out of luck in Mandelson's New World Order of the laws being run by
media corporations like some horrible Neuromancerish nightmare. Go and
<a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/dontdisconnectus/">sign the Number 10 petition</a> to say you don't want this. There are
7000 signatures already; the government has known form with ignoring
petitions that they don't want to hear, but with an election coming up
they can't ignore everything. <a href="http://threestrikes.openrightsgroup.org/">Send a message to Lord Mandelson
himself</a> via the Open Rights Group. <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">Contact your MP</a> and tell them
what an abomination you think this is. Go do these things now.</p>
