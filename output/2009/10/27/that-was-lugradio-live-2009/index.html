<p>So, that was LugRadio Live 2009. The last LugRadio Live conference ever.
We really mean it, this
time.<span style="color:red" title="More on this later.">*</span> Be
warned: this could get long. In short, it was a blast. There are
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=lrl2009">photos</a>.<span style="color:red" title="If you have photos, do upload them to flickr and tag them lrl2009">*</span>
We had <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/2009/talks.html">a great set of speakers</a>, and they did us proud. All the talks
were videoed, by LugRadio hero Tony Whitmore and his <span class="caps">AV</span> crew, and
they&#8217;ll be linked from the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/2009">LugRadio Live site</a> when they become
available. Particular highlights for me were <a href="http://www.gerv.net/">Gerv Markham</a>, who was
not only his usual sterling self but also loaned me a clicker for the
live show, and watching <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/" title="Image by Chris Budden, used without permission">Matthew Somerville</a> valiantly overcome
Windows pain to put together a presentation&nbsp;anyway. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisbudden/4038877121/"><img alt="People fussing around a projector" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/projector.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Actually, that bit of comedy probably needs a
bit more explanation. Matthew showed up with a presentation that
requires Windows — and already you can see the comedy begin to start —
and then his laptop wouldn&#8217;t work with the projector. So, the call went
out from the main stage: &#8220;Does anyone have a Windows laptop?&#8221; At an
open-source conference. Not one person said yes. Anyway, poor Matthew
eventually got his presentation up and running, in 8 glorious colours
(not 8-bit, you note: 8. It looked like a photo negative) and did a very
good job of introducing <a href="http://theatricalia.com/" title="Image by Peter Cannon, used without permission">Theatricalia</a> and various other&nbsp;things.  </p>
<p><a href="http://cannon-linux.co.uk/gallery/v/LugRadio+Live+UK/2009/Low_tech_twitter.JPG.html"><img alt="Scattered marginalia" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/lowtechtwitter.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We had the usual LugRadio Live array of random things scattered around
the venue; one I rather liked was Low-Tech Twitter, a paper version of
Twitter constructed with loving care by Peters Cannon and Oliver. You
cranked the handle round and then wrote your &#8220;tweet&#8221; in the next box to
come into view. It even had the fail whale for all the times it fell
apart while they were setting it up. Good work, lads. We also had a
LugRadio condolence book in which people could leave their messages for
the departing show (rather more than a few were cries for it to come
back next year, of which more shortly), a Technic Lego build-cool-things
competition, the return of the world-famous LugRadio Live potato stamps
as proof of
entry<span style="color:red" title="this year with water-based ink, which people still complained about; I guess they don't remember 2005 when the ink wouldn't wash off at all">*</span>
and some <em>really</em> big A0 posters of the schedule provided by head of
crew Ron. I didn&#8217;t realise just how big A0 was when I asked for them&#8230;
It&#8217;s the little things that people remember about your event, when it&#8217;s
gone. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t concentrate on the big stuff
— speakers, seating, refreshments — but throw in some cool bits as well.
They&#8217;re what put <em>your</em> personality on <em>your</em>&nbsp;event.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/duncansample/4039985776/"><img alt="The live on-screen twitter feed" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/twitterscreen.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We did something a bit new this year. The main stage had three display
screens. One, a free-standing screen off to the left, was used by our
resident artistic genius <a href="http://cbhworld.wordpress.com/">Chris Hayes</a>. Throughout the day, he drew
caricatures of each main stage speaker. These were fantastic, and
they&#8217;ll be published on the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/2009">LugRadio Live 2009</a>
website for everyone to marvel at in due course. Marvellous job, Chris;
lots of people commented on how cool it was to see the cartoons drawn in
real time, and I was really pleased with it. The second screen, one of
the two big ones, was for the speaker themselves to show their slides
on. No problem there. The third screen, taking up half of the back
wall&#8230;was a live Twitter feed for the hashtag #<a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23lrl2009">lrl2009</a>. One tweet
at a time on screen. Anonymously. This excited some comment. Now, making
the tweets anonymous was a deliberate decision of mine. In retrospect,
I&#8217;m not sure it was the right one, but I&#8217;m not as unconvinced as others.
My idea was that it would work sort of like a back-channel — people
watching the talks could comment on the talks as they were going on,
and, importantly, everyone else in the audience could see those comments
live as they were happening. Now, this anonymity means that people can
make what might be a negative comment about the speaker and feel <span class="caps">OK</span>
about doing it. And, to be honest, I expected a goodly amount of humour
to come out of this, and I was right. But&#8230;it made for a pretty harsh
environment for some of the speakers, particularly the first couple who
were on before the novelty of this new thing had worn off for the
audience. I think, with the laser-like vision granted by hindsight, I&#8217;d
have not made it anonymous, <em>except</em> for the live LugRadio recording —
the LugRadio team expect that sort of interaction with the audience, and
we&#8217;re at least partially about the comedy of the situation. Other
speakers aren&#8217;t. So, if you hated the live Twitter thing, blame me. If
you think it&#8217;s a great idea, on the other hand, you can do it at your
conference: <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/2009/fstwittertag/fstwittertag.html?q=lrl2009&amp;style=http://www.lugradio.org/live/2009/twitter.css">fstwittertag.html</a>?q=<strong>lrl2009</strong>&amp;style=<a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2009/twitter.css">custom.css</a> is
the <span class="caps">URL</span> we used, and you can replace the hashtag with whatever you want
to track, and pass a full <span class="caps">URL</span> to your custom <span class="caps">CSS</span> file for&nbsp;it.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41123187@N06/4040442723/"><img alt="The live show" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/allpresenters.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There was, of course, a live LugRadio&nbsp;recording. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteste/4048032744/"><img src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/jonoraccoon.jpg" alt="Jono in a raccoon suit"></a></p>
<p>I was really pleased with the live show; one of the best
we&#8217;ve done, I think. We talked about what&#8217;s changed in the tech world
since February 2004 when we started recording LugRadio (conclusion: not
much), and whether Oracle buying MySQL is a big problem (conclusion:
possibly, although people like me who don&#8217;t care about 20th century
technology like relational databases aren&#8217;t that worried), and the
audience really got involved in both things. We&#8217;d been sent a number of
copies of Jono&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/">The Art of Community</a>, and gave them out to
people for making insightful or amusing comments. For reasons passing
understanding, <a href="http://popey.com/blog/">Alan Pope</a> got three copies, and apparently <a href="http://twitter.com/mezzle/statuses/5126120981">had them
on eBay before we&#8217;d even finished</a>. We&#8217;d asked everyone at the event
to sign one of the LugRadio Live vinyl banners, and the
seven<span style="color:red" title="yes seven! more shortly on that">*</span>
presenters all signed another, and we gave one to <a href="http://www.jedimoose.org/">MrBen</a> for being
the community hero in perpituity, and auctioned the other banner, with
proceeds going to the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a>. And then, for the finale,
we had all seven presenters up on stage. Chris, Adam,
Ade<span style="color:red" title="with Abraham Lincoln beard in full effect">*</span>,
Matt<span style="color:red" title="and his son Alfie!">*</span>,
Sparkes<span style="color:red" title="he returns!">*</span>, Jono, and
me. It was great that all of us made it for the final LugRadio Live. We
got a standing ovation, which was rather nice. Yep, you read that right.
Final LugRadio Live. Now, I know we have known form with saying it&#8217;s the
last one ever and then it&#8217;s not, since we did the same last year, but
this time we mean it. However. We did a segment in the live show about
open source conferences in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. Our intention was to say: what should
replace LugRadio Live? Numerous people have said that there&#8217;s nothing
quite like <span class="caps">LRL</span> in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, and although we don&#8217;t want to run <span class="caps">LRL</span> any
more, we&#8217;d like there to be something a bit like it — a conference that
caters to people who want to have fun, not to people who want to buy
products or make partnerships or network. So, our intention with that
discussion was to say: what do you like about LugRadio Live? What don&#8217;t
you like about it? Which parts of <span class="caps">LRL</span> would you like to take forward
into a new conference? And then once people had come up with lots of
ideas, we were going to say, well, that sounds great: so who wants to
organise it, then? It won&#8217;t be LugRadio Live — that was our thing — but
we&#8217;d love to see someone else give us <em>their</em> view on what a fun <span class="caps">UK</span> open
source conference could
be.<span style="color:red" title="And that might be OggCamp, of which more in a moment.">*</span>
And then we got a question from the floor. &#8220;If someone organised a
conference next year, would you do a LugRadio live show at it?&#8221; That
had, honestly, never occurred to us. Not one of the presenters had even
considered this idea. So, after a few exchanged glances, we said: yes.
So it&#8217;s quite possible that there&#8217;ll be another conference next year,
crowd-sourced, or organised by a new group of people, or OggCamp <span class="caps">II</span>, or
something, and there&#8217;ll be a live LugRadio recording at it. You just
can&#8217;t keep a good thing down, it seems. There was the traditional
Saturday night party afterwards, too. This included <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Lugradio.Live.09.Karaoke">karaoke</a>, about
which the least said the better, I feel. Many thanks to Microsoft for
paying for it, though&nbsp;:-)  </p>

<p>The above-mentioned Tony Whitmore has, when not organising OggCamp or
helping plan LugRadio Live or, y&#8217;know, doing his job or sleeping, spent
the last eighteen months of his life creating a documentary called &#8220;The
Story Of LugRadio&#8221;. It&#8217;s <em>brilliant</em>. We showed it at lunchtime on the
main stage. It&#8217;ll be available soon, free to download. Everyone give
Tony a big pat on the back (and then ask when it&#8217;ll be&nbsp;uploaded).  </p>
<p><a href="http://oggcamp.org"><img src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/oggcamp-badge.png" alt="OggCamp"></a></p>
<p>The day after LugRadio Live was <a href="http://oggcamp.org">OggCamp</a>, a joint event
organised by the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu <span class="caps">UK</span> Podcast</a> and the <a href="http://linuxoutlaws.com/">Linux Outlaws</a>. It was
a really good laugh. Barcamp-style events stand or fall on how much fun
you have there, and they managed it rather neatly; they recorded a live
show (all of them together!), had some cool speakers, and did a raffle
during which we elegantly rigged it so Jono won a copy of his own book.
Heh, heh, heh. Good work, OggCamp people. I really hope it happens again
next&nbsp;year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/solexious/4041176822/"><img src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/lrl09shots/crew.jpg" alt="Image by Solexious, used under CC licence"></a></p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s that. Thank you very much to all our crew, especially Ron and
Dave M and Tony, all our sponsors, especially Matt Bloch at Bytemark,
all our audience, and everyone who cried out for more LugRadio next
year. It&#8217;s been a wild ride. Maybe we&#8217;ll be back. Oh, and if you&#8217;re
still feeling the need for podcasts with Jono and I in, keep your eyes
peeled for <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2009/10/20/shot-of-jaq">Shot of Jaq</a>&#8230;</p>
