			<p>Those of you who are involved with digital rights campaigning and live
in Europe may be aware that the European Parliament are currently
mulling over extending the pan-European term of copyright from 50 to 95
years. The <span class="caps">US</span> recently increased their term of copyright (at least
partially to &#8220;bring them in line&#8221; with Europe), and now Europe are being
asked to increase theirs (at least partially to &#8220;bring them in line&#8221;
with the <span class="caps">USA</span>). Copyright extension keeps music and composition and
created works away from the public: I won&#8217;t rehash the arguments in
favour of the public domain and against an ever-increasing term of
copyright; most people reading this are likely to have heard them
before, and if you have not then I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s
<em>Free Culture</em></a>, a book (and free-to-download e-book) which treats the
subject in exhaustive detail. Suffice to say that I&#8217;m convinced by these
arguments. Anyway, if you&#8217;re in Europe and you agree with me on this
rather than the music industry, you can write to your <span class="caps">MEP</span>. (In the <span class="caps">UK</span>,
you can do this through <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>.) My letter is below; it takes
various ideas from <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2009/01/21/consumers-citizens-and-information-professionals-around-the-world-unite-to-condemn-copyright-extension/">Open Rights Group</a> <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2009/01/16/come-to-brussels-and-demand-sound-copyright/">writings</a> and <a href="http://solitude.vkps.co.uk/Archives/2009/01/27/copyright-extension/">Gary
Fleming&#8217;s similar letter</a>. Note: don&#8217;t just copy mine (or anyone
else&#8217;s). Your MEPs need to hear from <em>you</em>, their constituent, in your
own&nbsp;words.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Dear [my MEPs], I am writing to you all today because you represent me
in the European Parliament. As such, I would like to bring to your
attention my concern (a concern shared by many others) over the proposed
extensions to European Copyright law (the Term Extension Directive). You
and your fellow MEPs are being asked to nearly double the term of
copyright afforded to sound recordings. Industry lobbyists suggest that
extending copyright term will help increase the welfare of performers
and session musicians. But the Term Extension Directive, which will be
voted on by the Legal Affairs Committee in a few weeks’ time, will do no
such thing. Instead it will hand millions of euros over to the world’s
four major record labels, money that will come direct from the pockets
of European consumers. The Commission&#8217;s own Impact Statement states that
increased sales revenues from the extension of copyright terms will be
divided approximately 90% to the record labels and 9% to the top fifth
of performers, leaving only one-onehundredth of these financial benefits
to go to the remaining 80% of musicians. This one-onehundredth actually
means that the projected gains for the vast majority of performers are
meagre: the highest-earning of these performers can expect to receive 27
euros a year. Twenty-six euros is not likely to significantly benefit
the welfare of a performer or session musician! The <span class="caps">UK</span> has shown itself
to be a leader in intellectual property policy; the Gowers Review of
Intellectual Property, conducted at the request of the <span class="caps">UK</span> government,
specifically recommended against increasing the term of copyright. It
may amuse you to note that the <span class="caps">USA</span> extended their length of copyright
terms &#8220;to bring them in line with Europe&#8221;; you and your <span class="caps">MEP</span> colleagues
are now being asked to extend European copyright, in part to &#8220;bring us
in line&#8221; with the <span class="caps">USA</span>! Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, who advises the
European Commission on intellectual property issues, wrote an open
letter in which he called the proposed extension &#8220;a deliberate attempt
on behalf of the Commission to mislead Europe’s Parliament&#8221;. Andrew
Gowers himself has spoken out in an article in the Financial Times in
December against this &#8220;out of tune&#8221; extension. If you honestly believe
that almost doubling the term of copyright in the <span class="caps">EU</span> and ensuring that
the majority of the money thus gained goes to record labels is a good
thing, then I can respect your views. However, if you think that you&#8217;re
being asked to exercise your power as our elected representatives when
you may not have been given the most germane facts to the case at hand,
then I&#8217;ll suggest here some further resources you may find useful.
Consumer advocates have produced a video, &#8220;How copyright term extension
in Sound Recordings actually works&#8221;, which is available at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijON_XODUk for you to watch, and I&#8217;d
urge you to so watch it. A joint statement, signed by the European
Bureau of Library, Information and Documentation Associations (<span class="caps">EBLIDA</span>),
42 consumer rights organisations across Europe, and and <span class="caps">IFLA</span>, the
umbrella organisation representing over 650,000 library and information
professionals worldwide, was sent to MEPs who sit on the committees that
will decide the flawed Term Extension Directive’s future; you can read
the statement at
http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2009/01/21/consumers-citizens-and-information-professionals-around-the-world-unite-to-condemn-copyright-extension/
and see more detail. I would urge you to vote to reject the Term
Extension Directive, as per Amendment 15 of the <span class="caps">ITRE</span> opinion (David
Hammerstein). I&#8217;m happy to discuss this further if you would like to.
Best regards, Stuart&nbsp;Langridge</p>
