			<p>I've spent the evening fuming. Earlier this evening, <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">Norm</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/cackhanded/status/2893059481">said</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use a Mac because I value my time at more than
£0/hour.<span style="color:red" title="quoting jwz">*</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate that sort of comment. It's a typical snide, sneering aside from a
Mac user to someone who uses Linux. The subtext, which is hardly <em>sub</em>
at all, is "clearly you don't value your time because you spend it
playing around compiling your kernel and fighting your operating
system". Suggesting that <em>obviously</em> I've never considered using a Mac
because I'm <em>too stupid</em> to realise that my life would be <em>so</em> much
easier. Like I spend all my day compiling a kernel, which I haven't done
for about a decade. Like they've seen the great wide ocean of
possibility in front of them and I'm still scrabbling around on the
beach looking at
stones.<span style="color:red" title="quoting Ponder Stibbons, quoting Isaac Newton">*</span>
I was all ready to fire back something equally snide. "Yeah, I value
trust at something more than £0." Or "what do you use the time for,
clicking 'no I don't want Quicktime Pro' dialogs???" Or something
equally mature. Or maybe an email to Norm, saying: do you realise how
offensive a comment that is? Do you realise how sneering and
holier-than-thou it sounds? And then I thought, now, hang on, this is
Norm. He's a sensible guy. The second half of his comment, after all,
was "Free OSs are good, OS X is great." He uses Linux all the time. And
then came the second, darker, thought: that his comment was in reaction
to one of mine. The conversational thread went:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/sil/status/2892721771">sil</a>: although does anyone not run ff3.5? what is this, the
    middle ages? :)</li>
<li><em>anonymous</em>: why on earth would any OS X users run FF 3.5? Firefox
    is slow, crashes frequently, and is generally quite buggy on Macs.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/sil/status/2892773228">sil</a>: feel free to adapt the question to "why is anyone using a
    Mac" as well if you like. :)</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/cackhanded/status/2893059481">Norm</a>: I use a Mac because I value my time at more than
    £0/hour. Free OSs are good, OS X is great.</li>
</ul>
<p>And do you know, I was <strong>just as snide and nasty</strong>. That was a humbling
thought. There's a lot of intolerant comment out there. There are plenty
of people who really think that a modern Linux is still all about
compiling your kernel and compiling all your programs and configuring
your machine in emacs and not actually doing anything constructive. We,
the Linux community, tend to either shake our heads and wait for them to
catch up (in the best case) or flame the shit out of them like whiny
teenagers banned from the cinema for throwing popcorn (in the worse
cases). But there are an awful lot of people out there who think that
Macs only have one mouse button and are just "shiny" with no underlying
decency behind them. I try to not think that but, well, it's easy to
make that generalisation just to score cheap points, just like it's easy
to suggest that Linux users waste their time compiling kernels for the
same cheap points. I should do that less. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/chrome_os_context#fn2-2009-07-10">John Gruber said</a> recently,
"With regard to the freedoms that stem from the software being open
source, something like Ubuntu isn’t just, say, ten times better than
Windows or Mac OS X, it is infinitely better." Sometimes I forget that
just because my stuff's infinitely better, it doesn't mean that I can
divide by that infinity to conclude that their stuff's worth zero, and
it certainly doesn't mean that <em>they</em> think it's worth
zero.<span style="color:red" title="if you were about to comment on how dividing by infinity is undefined rather than zero, you have rather missed the point">*</span>
So, sorry, Norm. I'll try and do better next time.</p>
