I do not wholly agree. So, here are some arguments against, or at least perpendicular to. Whether this is in grateful thanks of or cold-eyed revenge about him making me drink a limoncello and Red Bull last week can remain a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary about footnotes on the web tends to boil down into two categories: that they're foot, and that they're notes. Everybody&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-1" class="simple-footnote" title="sensible"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; agrees that being foot is a problem. Having a meaningless little symbol in some text which you then have to scroll down to the end of a document to understand is stupid. But, and here's the point, &lt;em&gt;nobody does this&lt;/em&gt;. Unless a document on the web was straight up machine-converted from its prior life as a printed thing, any "footnotes" therein will have had some effort made to conceptually locate the content of the footnote inline with the text that it's footnoting. That might be a link which jumps you down to the bottom, or it might be placed at the side, or it might appear inline when clicked on, or it might appear in a popover, but the content of a "footnote" can be reached without your thread of attention being diverted from the point where you were previously&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-2" class="simple-footnote" title="for good implementations, anyway; if you make your footnotes a link down to the end of the document, and then don't provide a link back via either the footnote marker or by adding it to the end, then you are a bad web author and I condemn you to constantly find unpaired socks, forever"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's right about the numbers&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-3" class="simple-footnote" title="or, ye gods and little fishes, a selection of mad typographic symbols which most people can't even type and need to be copied from the web search results for &amp;quot;that little squiggly section thingy&amp;quot;"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; being meaningless, though, and that they're bad link text; the number "3" gives no indication of what's hidden behind it, and the analogy with "click here" as link text is a good one. We'll come back to this, but it is a correct objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a footnote, anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="footnotes-being-set-off"&gt;The issue with footnotes being set off this way (that is: that they're notes) isn't, though, that it's bad (which it is), it's that the alternatives are worse, at least in some situations. A footnote is an extra bit of information which is relevant to what you're reading, but not important enough that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to read it right now. That might be because it's explanatory (that is: it expands and enlarges on the main point being made, but isn't directly required), or because it's a reference (a citation, or a link out to where this information was found so it can be looked up later and to prove that the author didn't just make this up), or because it's commentary (where you don't want to disrupt the text that's written with additions inline, maybe because you didn't write it). Or, and this is important, because it's funnier to set it off like this. A footnote used this way is like the voice of the narrator in The Perils of Penelope Pitstop being funny about the situation. Look, I'll choose a random book from my bookshelf&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-4" class="simple-footnote" title="alright, I chose a random Terry Pratchett book to make the point, I admit; I'm not stupid. But it really was the closest one to hand; I didn't spend extra time looking for particularly good examples"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reaper Man&lt;/em&gt; by Terry Pratchett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/pratchett-footnote-example.jpg" alt="A photograph of a book page. Most of the text is a little blurred to distract attention from it. Midway down the page, unblurred text reads: 'Even the industrial-grade crystal ball was only there as a sop to her customers. Mrs Cake could actually read the future in a bowl of porridge.¹ She could have a revelation in a panful of frying bacon.' At the bottom of the page is the text referenced by the footnote marker, which reads: '¹ It would say, for example, that you would shortly undergo a painful bowel movement.'"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is done because it's funny. Alternatives... would not be funny.&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-5" class="simple-footnote" title='This is basically "explaining the joke", something which squashes all the humour out of it like grapes in a press. Sorry, PTerry.'&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the industrial-grade crystal ball was only there as a sop to her customers. Mrs Cake could actually read the future in a bowl of porridge. (It would say, for example, that you would shortly undergo a painful bowel movement.) She could have a revelation in a panful of frying bacon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then it's too distracting, isn't it? That's giving the thing too much prominence; it derails the point and then you have to get back on board after reading it. Similarly with making it a long note via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or via making it &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section role="aside"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and Jake does make the point that that's for longer notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the industrial-grade crystal ball was only there as a sop to her customers. Mrs Cake could actually read the future in a bowl of porridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Note&lt;/summary&gt;It would say, for example, that you would shortly undergo a painful bowel movement.&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could have a revelation in a panful of frying bacon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, admittedly, half the reason Pratchett's footnotes are funny is because they're imitating the academic use. But the other half is that there is a place for that "voice of the narrator" to make snarky asides, and we don't really have a better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the parenthesis is the best way to do it. Look at the explanations of "explanatory", "reference", and "commentary" in &lt;a href="#footnotes-being-set-off"&gt;the paragraph above about what a footnote is&lt;/a&gt;. They needed to be inline; the definition of what I mean by "explanatory" should be read along with the word, and you need to understand my definition to understand why I think it's important. It's directly relevant. So it's inline; you must not proceed without having read it. It's not a footnote. But that's not always the case; sometimes you want to expand on what's been written without requiring the reader to read that expansion in order to proceed. It's a help; an addition; something relevant but not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; relevant. (I think this is behind the convention that footnotes are in smaller text, personally; it's a typographic convention that this represents the niggling or snarky or helpful "voice in your head", annotating the ongoing conversation. But I haven't backed this up with research or anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's the alternative?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, this is the point. Assume for the moment that I'm right&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-6" class="simple-footnote" title="I always do"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and that there is some need for this type of annotation -- something which is important enough to be referenced here but not important enough that you must read it to proceed. How do we represent that in a document?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake's approaches are all reasonable in some situations. A note section (a "sidebar", I think newspaper people would call it?) works well for long clarifying paragraphs, little biographies of a person you've referenced, or whatever. If that content is less obviously relevant then hiding it behind a collapsed revealer triangle is even better. Short stuff which is that smidge more relevant gets promoted to be entirely inline and put in brackets. Stuff which is entirely reference material (citations, for example) don't really need to be in text in the document at all; don't footnote your point and then make a citation which links to the source, just link the text you wrote directly to the source. That certainly is a legacy of print media. There are annoying problems with most of the alternatives (a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can't go in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; even if inline, which is massively infuriating; sidenotes are great on wide screens but you still need to solve this problem on narrow, so they can't be the answer alone.) You can even put the footnote text in a tooltip, which helps people with mouse pointers or (maybe) keyboard navigation, and is what I do right here on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... if you've got a point which isn't important enough to be inline and isn't long enough to get its own box off to the side, then it's gotta go &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, and if that somewhere isn't "right there inline" then it's gotta be somewhere &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;, and... that's what a footnote &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, right? Some text elsewhere that you link to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can certainly take advantage of being a digital document to display the annotation inline if the user chooses to (by clicking on it or similar), or to show a popover (which paper can't do). But if the text isn't displayed to you up front, then you have to click on something to show it, and that thing you click on must not itself be distracting. That means the thing you click on must be small, and not contentful. Numbers (or little symbols) are not too bad an approach, in that light. The technical issues here are dispensed with easily enough, as &lt;a href="https://front-end.social/@leaverou/114784950642671149"&gt;Lea Verou&lt;/a&gt; points out: yes, put a bigger hit target around your little undistracting numbers so they're not too hard to tap on, that's important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Lea goes on to say, and Jake mentioned above... how do we deal with the idea that "3" needs to be both "small and undistracting" but also "give context so it's not just a meaningless number"? This is a real problem; pretty much by definition, if your "here is something which will show you extra information" marker gives you context about what that extra information &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, then it's long enough that you actually have to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; it to understand the context, and therefore it's distracting.&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-7" class="simple-footnote" title="I've seen people do footnote markers which are little words rather than numbers, and it's dead annoying. I get what they're trying to do, which is to solve this context problem, but it's worse"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This isn't really a circle that can be squared: these two requirements are in opposition, and so a compromise is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lea makes the same point with "How to provide context without increasing prominence? Wrapping part of the text with a link could be a better anchor, but then how to distinguish from actual links? Perhaps we need a convention." And I agree. I think we need a convention for this. But... I think we've already &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; a convention, no? A little superscript number or symbol means "this is a marker for additional information, which you need to interact with&lt;sup id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-8" class="simple-footnote" title="you might 'interact' with this marker by clicking on it in a digital document, or by looking it up at the bottom of the page in a print doc, but it's all interaction"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get that additional information". Is it a perfect convention? No: the numbers are semantically meaningless. Is there a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; convention? I'm not sure there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An end on't&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Jake's right: a whole bunch of things that are currently presented on the web as "here's a little (maybe clickable) number, click it to jump to the end of the document to read a thing" could be presented much better with a little thought. We web authors could do better at this. But should footnotes go away? I don't think so. Once all the cases of things that should be done better &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; done better, there'll still be some left. I don't hate footnotes. I do hate limoncello and Red Bull, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-1"&gt;sensible &lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-2"&gt;for good implementations, anyway; if you make your footnotes a link down to the end of the document, and then &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; provide a link &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; via either the footnote marker or by adding it to the end, then you are a bad web author and I condemn you to constantly find unpaired socks, forever &lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-3"&gt;or, ye gods and little fishes, a selection of mad typographic symbols which most people can't even type and need to be copied from the web search results for "&lt;a href="https://nerdtechy.com/how-to-type-double-s-vertical-symbol"&gt;that little squiggly section thingy&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;a href="#sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-limited-defence-of-footnotes-4"&gt;alright, I chose a random &lt;em&gt;Terry Pratchett&lt;/em&gt; book to make the point, I admit; I'm not stupid.

It would be nice to put the video of the event up somewhere so other people who weren't there could watch it. Obvious answer: upload it to YouTube. However, the video that was shown &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; the event is Copyrighted Media Content and therefore is disallowed by YouTube and the copyright holder; it's not demonetised (which wouldn't be a problem), it's flat-out blocked. So YouTube is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like the video I'm posting to stick around for a long time; this is a sort of archival, reference thing where not many people will ever want to watch it but those that do might want to do so in ten years. So I'm loath to find some other random video hosting site, which will probably go bust, or pivot to selling online AI shoes or something. And the best way to ensure that something keeps going long-term is to put it on your own website, and use decent HTML, because that means that even in ten or twenty years it'll still work where the latest flavour-of-the-month thing will go the way of other old technologies and fade away and stop working over time. HTML won't do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... it's an hour long and in full HD. 2.6GB of video. And one of the benefits of YouTube is that they'll make the video adaptive: it'll fit the screen, and the bandwidth, of whatever device someone's watching it on. If someone wants to look at this from their phone and its slightly-shaky two bars of 4G connection, they probably don't want to watch the loading spinner for an hour while it buffers a full HD video; they can ideally get a cut down, lower-quality but quicker to serve, version. But... how is this possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two aspects to doing this. One is that you serve up different &lt;em&gt;resolutions&lt;/em&gt; of video, based on the viewer's screen size. This is exactly the same problem as is solved for images by the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;picture&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to provide responsive images (where if you're on a 400px-wide screen you get a 400px version of the background image, not the 2000px full-res version), and indeed the magic words to search for here are &lt;em&gt;responsive video&lt;/em&gt;. And the person you will find who is explaning all this is &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scottjehl.com"&gt;Scott Jehl&lt;/a&gt;, who has written &lt;a href="https://scottjehl.com/posts/using-responsive-video/"&gt;a good description of how to do responsive video&lt;/a&gt; which explains it all in detail. You make versions of the video at different resolutions, and serve whichever one best matches the screen you're on, just like responsive images. Nice work; just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's also a second aspect to this: responsive video adapts to screen size, but it doesn't adapt to bandwidth. What we want, in addition to the responsive stuff, is that on poor connections the viewer gets a lower-bandwidth version as well as a lower-resolution version, and that the viewer's browser can dynamically switch from moment to moment between different versions of the video to match their current network speed. This task is the job of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming"&gt;HTTP Live Streaming&lt;/a&gt;, or HLS. To do this, you essentially encode the video in a bunch of different qualities and screen sizes, so you've got a bunch of separate videos (which you've probably already done above for the responsive part) and then (and this is the key) you chop up each video into a load of small segments. That way, instead of the browser downloading the whole one hour of video at a particular resolution, it only downloads the next &lt;em&gt;segment&lt;/em&gt; at its current choice of resolution, and then if you suddenly get more (or less) bandwidth, it can switch to getting segment 2 from a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; version of the video which better matches where you currently are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this sounds hard. Fortunately, all hard things to do with video are handled by ffmpeg. There's a nice writeup by Mux on &lt;a href="https://www.mux.com/articles/how-to-convert-mp4-to-hls-format-with-ffmpeg-a-step-by-step-guide"&gt;how to convert an mp4 video to HLS with ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;, and it works great. I put myself together a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/stuartlangridge/c0ae266306604c7db23e9855eea83976"&gt;little Python script&lt;/a&gt; to construct the ffmpeg command line to do it, but you can do it yourself; the script just does some of the boilerplate for you. Very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I can serve up a video which adapts to the viewer's viewing conditions, and that's just what I wanted. I have to pay for the bandwidth now (which is the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; benefit of having YouTube do it, and one I now don't get) but that's worth it for this, I think. Cheers to Scott and Mux for explaining all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2025-04-16:/days/2025/04/16/serving-streaming-video-that-adapts-to-bandwidth-from-your-own-website/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>Use RSS to read newsletters</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/02/08/use-rss-to-read-newsletters/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone's got a newsletter these days (like everyone's got a podcast). In general, I think this is OK: instead of going through a middleman publisher, have a direct connection from you to the people who want to read what you say, so that that audience can't be taken away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I don't actually &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; newsletters. I don't really like giving my email address to random people&lt;sup id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-1" class="simple-footnote" title="despite how it's my business to do so and it's right there on the front page of the website, I know, I know"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and frankly an email app is not a great way to read long-form text! There are many apps which are a lot better at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to this and the solution is called RSS. &lt;a href="https://bell.bz/love-newsletters-youre-gonna-love-rss/"&gt;Andy Bell explains RSS&lt;/a&gt; and this is exactly how I read newsletters. If I want to read someone's newsletter and it's on Substack, or ghost.io, or buttondown.email, what I actually do is subscribe to their newsletter &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; what I'm actually subscribing to is their RSS feed. This sections off newsletter stuff into a completely separate app that I can catch up on when I've got the time, it means that the newsletter owner (or the site they're using) can't decide to "upsell" me on other stuff they do that I'm not interested in, and it's a better, nicer reading experience than my mail app.&lt;sup id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-2" class="simple-footnote" title="Is all of this doable in my mail client? Sure. I could set up filters, put newsletters into their own folders/labels, etc. But that's working around a problem rather than solving it"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="https://netnewswire.com/"&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt; on my iOS phone, but there are a bunch of other newsreader apps for every platform and you should choose whichever one you want. Andy lists a bunch, above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, of course, then becomes: how do you find the RSS feed for a thing you want to read?&lt;sup id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-3" class="simple-footnote" title="I suggested to Andy that he ought to write this post explaining how to do this and then realised that I should do it myself and stop being such a lazy snipe, so here it is"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Well, it turns out... you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to subscribe to a newsletter, you literally just put the web address of the newsletter itself into your RSS reader, and that reader will take care of finding the feed and subscribing to it, for you. It's magic. Hooray! I've tested this with substack, with ghost.io, with buttondown.email, and it works with all of them. You don't need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work, then there is one neat alternative you can try, though. &lt;a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/"&gt;Kill The Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; will give you an email address for any site you name, and provide the incoming emails to that &lt;em&gt;as an RSS feed&lt;/em&gt;. So, if you've found a newsletter which &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; exist on the web (boo hiss!) and doesn't provide an RSS feed, then you go to KTN, it gives you some randomly-generated email address, you subscribe to the intransigent newsletter &lt;em&gt;with that email address&lt;/em&gt;, and then you can subscribe to the resultant feed in your RSS reader. It's dead handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a newsletter and it &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; have an RSS feed and you want it to have, then have a look at whatever newsletter software you use; it will almost certainly provide a way to create one, and you might have to tick a box. (You might also want to complain to the software creators that that box wasn't ticked by default.) If you've got an RSS feed for the newsletter that you write, but putting your site's address into an RSS reader doesn't &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; that RSS feed, then what you need is &lt;a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery"&gt;RSS autodiscovery&lt;/a&gt;, which is the "magic" alluded to above; you add a line to your site's HTML in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section which reads &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="https://URL/of/your/feed"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and then it'll work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this. Read newsletters at my pace, in my choice of app, on my terms. More of that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-1"&gt;despite how it's my business to do so and it's right there on the front page of the website, I know, I know &lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-2"&gt;Is all of this doable in my mail client? Sure. I could set up filters, put newsletters into their own folders/labels, etc. But that's working around a problem rather than solving it &lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-3"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sil.kryogenix.org/post/3lhnuv42cqk2e"&gt;suggested to Andy&lt;/a&gt; that he ought to write this post explaining how to do this and then realised that I should do it myself and stop being such a lazy snipe, so here it is &lt;a href="#sf-use-rss-to-read-newsletters-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 15:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2025-02-08:/days/2025/02/08/use-rss-to-read-newsletters/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>Blog Questions Challenge</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/02/03/blog-questions-challenge/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The latest thing circulating around people still blogging is the Blog Questions Challenge; &lt;a href="https://hicks.design/journal/blog-questions-challenge"&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; did it (and &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@jonhicks/113922089500368028"&gt;asked if I was&lt;/a&gt;) and so have &lt;a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21674"&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/blog-questions-challenge/"&gt;Ethan&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of others, so clearly it is time I should get on board, fractionally late as ever.&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-1" class="simple-footnote" title="In my defence, it was my birthday."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why did you start blogging in the first place?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other people I admired were doing it. I think the person I was most influenced by to start doing it was &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net"&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;, who is also still at it&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-2" class="simple-footnote" title="although no longer at simon.incutio.com -- what even was Incutio?"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but a whole bunch of people got on board at around that same time, back in the early days when you be a medium-sized fish in a small pool just by participating. Mark Pilgrim springs to mind as well -- that's a good example of having influence, when the "standard format" of permalinks got sort of hashed out collectively to be &lt;code&gt;/2025/02/03/blog-questions-challenge,&lt;/code&gt; which a lot of places still adhere to (although it feels faintly quaint, these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a lot of the early posts on this site are short two-sentence half-paragraph things, throwaway thoughts, and that all got sucked up by social media... but social media hadn't been invented, back in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also interestingly: the second post on this here blog&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-3" class="simple-footnote" title='I resisted the word "blog" for a long time, calling it a "weblog", and the activity being "weblogging", because "blog" is such an ugly word. Like most of the fights I was picking in the mid 2000s, this also seems faintly antiquated and passé now. Sic transit gloria mundi and all that.'&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2002/04/21/release/"&gt;bitching at Mozilla about the Firefox release schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing new under the sun.&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-4" class="simple-footnote" title="or &amp;quot;nihil sub sole novum&amp;quot;, since we're doing Latin quotes today"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cor. When it started, this site was being run by &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/castalian/"&gt;Castalian&lt;/a&gt;, which was basically "classic ASP but Python instead of VBScript", a thing I built. This is because I was using ASP at work on Windows machines, so that was the model for "dynamic web pages" that I understood, but I wasn't on Windows&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-5" class="simple-footnote" title="and Windows's relationship with Python has always been a bit unsteady, although it's better these days now that Microsoft are prepared to acknowledge that other people can have ideas"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and so I built it myself. No idea if it still works and I very much doubt it since it's old enough to buy all the drinks these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that it was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; for a bit and then, because I'd discovered the idea of funky caching&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-6-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-6" class="simple-footnote" title='you write the pages in an online form, but then a server process builds a static HTML version of them; the advanced version of this where pages were only built on request was called "funky caching" back then'&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it was &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/vellum/"&gt;Vellum&lt;/a&gt;, that model (a) in Python and (b) written by me. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; for a while it was "Thort", which was based on CouchDB&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-7-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-7" class="simple-footnote" title="if a disinterested observer were to consider this progression, they might unfairly but accurately conclude that whatever this site runs on is basically a half-arsed system I built based on the latest thing I'm interested in, mightn't they?"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and then it was WordPress, and then in 2014 I &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/02/13/static-electricity/"&gt;switched from WP to a static build&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href="https://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, which it still is to this day. Crikey, that was over ten years ago!&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-8-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-8" class="simple-footnote" title="tempus fugit. OK, I'll stop now."&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I like static site generators: I even wrote &lt;a href="https://websitesetup.org/best-static-site-generators/"&gt;10 Popular Static Site Generators&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago for WebsiteSetup which I think is still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my text editor, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;. The static setup is here on my machine; I write a post, I type &lt;code&gt;make kryogenix&lt;/code&gt;, and it runs a whole little series of scripts which invoke Pelican to build the static HTML for the blog, do a few things that I've added (such as add footnote handling&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-9-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-9" class="simple-footnote" title="like this!"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, make &lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt; links and images&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-10-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-10" class="simple-footnote" title="an idea I stole shamelessly from Zach Leatherman"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and sort of handle webmentions but that's broken at the moment) and then copy it up to my actual website (via git) to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all a bit lashed together, to be honest, but this whole website is like that. It is something like an ancient city, such as London or Rome; what this site is mostly built on is the ruins of the previous history of the city. Sometimes the older bits poke through because they're still actually OK, or they never got updated; sometimes they've been replaced with the new shiny. You should see the &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file, which operates a bewildering set of redirects through about six different generations of URLs so &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI"&gt;all the old links still work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-11-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-11" class="simple-footnote" title="Outgoing links are made to continue to work via unrot.link from the excellent Remy Sharp"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When do you feel most inspired to write?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the muse seizes me. Sometimes that's a lot; sometimes not. I do quite a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/books/"&gt;paid writing&lt;/a&gt; as part of my various day jobs for others, and quite a lot of creative writing as part of running a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pbproleplaying3278"&gt;play-by-post D&amp;amp;D campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and that sucks up a reasonable amount of the writing energy, but there are things which just demand going on the website. Normally these days it's things where I want them to be a reference of some kind -- maybe of a useful tech thing, or some important thought, or something interesting -- for myself or for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively you might think the answer is "while in the pub, which leads to making random notes in an email to myself from my phone and then writing a blog post when I get home" and while this is not true, it's not &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true either. I do not want to do a histogram of posting times from this site because I am worried that I will find that the majority are at, like, 11.15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always post immediately. I have discovered about myself that, for semi-ephemeral stuff like posts here or projects that I do for fun, that I need to get them done as part of that initial burst of inspiration and energy. If I don't get it done, then my enthusiasm will fade and they will linger half-finished for ever and never get completed. I don't necessarily &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; this, but I've learned to live with it. If I think of an idea for a post and write a note about it and then &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; do it, when I rediscover the note a week later it will not seem anything like as compelling. So posts are mostly written as one long stream-of-consciousness to capitalise on the burning of the creative fire before it gets doused by time or work or everything going on in the world. Carpe diem, I guess.&lt;sup id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-12-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-12" class="simple-footnote" title="I was lying about not doing this any more, obviously"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s your favourite post on your blog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/02/04/it-s-cold-outside/"&gt;It's Cold Outside&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/11/monkey-island-2-for-about-the-fifth-time/"&gt;Monkey Island 2, for about the fifth time&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/10/15/charles-paget-wade-and-the-underthing/"&gt;Charles Paget Wade and the Underthing&lt;/a&gt; for writing, although each of them have little burrs in the wording that I want to polish when I re-read them. The &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/01/30/forty-nine/"&gt;series of birthday posts&lt;/a&gt; have been going on since the beginning, one every year, which probably wins for consistency. For technical stuff, maybe &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/05/13/some-thoughts-on-soonsnap-and-little-big-details/"&gt;Some thoughts on soonsnap and little big details&lt;/a&gt; (now sadly defunct) or &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2013/06/06/the-thing-and-the-whole-of-the-thing-on-drm-in-html/"&gt;The thing and the whole of the thing: on DRM in HTML&lt;/a&gt;. I like my own writing, mostly. Arrogant, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really at the moment, but, as above, these things tend to arrive in a blizzard of excitement and implementation and then linger forever once done. But right now... it all seems to work OK. Ask me when I get back from the pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I should probably point back at some of the people who inspired me to do this or other things and keep doing so to this day. So &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/"&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://remysharp.com/"&gt;Remy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-1"&gt;In my defence, it was &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/01/30/forty-nine/"&gt;my birthday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-2"&gt;although no longer at &lt;code&gt;simon.incutio.com&lt;/code&gt; -- what even was Incutio? &lt;a href="#sf-blog-questions-challenge-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-blog-questions-challenge-3"&gt;I resisted the word "blog" for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time, calling it a "weblog", and the activity being "weblogging", because "blog" is such an ugly word.

&lt;p&gt;49 is the first square where the digits are squares. In this case, 4 and 9 are square numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that 49 is an age of squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself increasingly OK with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting, although really quite disillusioning, reading through the series of posts I've done on my birthday (follow the links back from &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/01/30/somewhere-between-silver-and-tin/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; for 22 years now) and seeing the trend in recent years. The world has got more worrying. A lot more. I hate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've tried to find joy where I can get it. I'll give you an example. I looked up the number 49 for this, the same as I always do, and apparently 49 is the smallest discriminant of a totally real cubic field. Now, I'm sure that there are maths people out there who understand this. But to me, it is impossible to read this without putting on a mock Valley bro accent: &lt;em&gt;yeah brah, this field is&lt;/em&gt; todally &lt;em&gt;real, yah?&lt;/em&gt; And that made me smile. Bill dropped a birthday message on me at half seven this morning. Yesterday, I remembered a throwaway joke line that &lt;a href="https://popey.com/"&gt;popey&lt;/a&gt; dropped on me in 2015 and I literally laughed out loud in my own living room at the thought of it. Two days ago &lt;a href="https://jessica.tech"&gt;Jess&lt;/a&gt; and I went to see &lt;a href="https://murderontheorientexpressplay.com/"&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/a&gt; on stage at the Alexandra Theatre. Tonight I've been for beers with &lt;a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk"&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt; and Matt. My D&amp;amp;D group are about to confront Harazos to let them perform a ritual they've made up. Everyone in my team at Barnardo's was really nice about my birthday. None of this helps fix the world crashing down around us, but all of it certainly makes it easier to cope with, because all of it is a little bit of joy, of niceness, in the midst of unjoy and unniceness. Thank you, all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been not a great year. There's been ups and there's been downs. I'm still a lot better off than almost everyone -- I'm not under threat, I'm not more under threat than I was before, I can afford to do what I like as long as what I like isn't too extravagant. But it has nonetheless been tough. Maybe 2025 will be better, although to be honest I doubt it. And I have this sense of regret, not about the world getting worse, but that the idea that the world might get better has basically gone away. When I was younger, the thing was that the world &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; get better, year on year, as time passed. And I am 100% sure that this was a thing that I got to think because I was privileged to not be being screwed over by the world. But I still had that thought, that things were OK today and would be slightly more than OK tomorrow, and at some point that went away. Things probably won't be better tomorrow. If they're the same, that probably in itself is a victory. This isn't really my tragedy; it's for people younger than me, who haven't experienced this change, who assume that things getting steadily more grey and sad and worse is just the way the world is; that's just &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I look for little bits of joy. Hopefully you have some little bits of joy yourself, as I do. Happy birthday to you, even if it's not your birthday. Eat some cake.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2025-01-30:/days/2025/01/30/forty-nine/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>My Keys</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/11/04/my-keys/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have a problematic relationship with keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's not true. I have a problematic relationship with key &lt;em&gt;rings&lt;/em&gt;. For some reason, my pockets are a violently hostile environment for things I put in them. I don't really understand why this is, but it's true. Keyrings bend out of shape; the concentric rings separate, and my actual keys fall off of them. People have expressed scepticism about this in the past, and they've been wrong and I've been right. The last time I complained about this, I thought I'd come up with a solution where I bought a keyring which was a tiny padlock. It lasted three days before a bolt sheared off. You can see the whole thing on &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/twitter/1192443341889265667/"&gt;posts made to twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point most people would give up, or be sad, or just live with split rings continually letting them down. But most people don't have a dad who is a king of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad made me this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/keyring.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a keyring. It's a solid block of brass with the middle cut out, so it looks like a very shallow "U", or like three sides of a long rectangle. There's a hole drilled in each of the short ends, and a long bolt is threaded through those holes. On one end of the bolt is a nut, tight against the outside of the "U", and the bolt protrudes out about an inch where there's another, locking, nut. All the keys are hung from the bolt. To add a new key, I undo the locking nut on the end, undo the tight nut, pull the bolt out, hang another key from it, and then do everything back up. It's &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt;. I've not had a single problem with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you carefully studying the picture will notice that there is writing on the brass "U". (And will also notice that I've blacked out the details of the actual keys, because you can cut a key based on a picture, and I'm not stupid.) That's engraving, which mentions my website, so if I lose my keys (which I am really careful to not do&lt;sup id="sf-my-keys-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-my-keys-1" class="simple-footnote" title="the historical version of checking your pockets, as a man, was to feel for &amp;quot;spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch&amp;quot; -- this was actually a ribald mnemonic for how to cross yourself as a Catholic, but this modern day man checks his pockets for keys, wallet, and phone in the same way to check they're not lost"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) then whoever finds them can get in touch with me to tell me that happened but my address is not on the keys, so a nefarious finder gets less benefit from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my keyring. It's the best. I do not know why more keyrings are not like this. It works just like a normal keyring (I have non-key things on mine, such as a USB stick and a tiny flashlight, but they would go on a regular split-ring keyring as well), but it doesn't just fail all the time like normal ones do. I surely can't be the only person who experiences this? Anyway, I don't mind, 'cos I have the solution. Cheers, dad. Maybe I should make this a product or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-my-keys-1"&gt;the historical version of checking your pockets, as a man, was to feel for "spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch" -- this was actually a ribald mnemonic for how to cross yourself as a Catholic, but this modern day man checks his pockets for keys, wallet, and phone in the same way to check they're not lost &lt;a href="#sf-my-keys-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 22:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2024-11-04:/days/2024/11/04/my-keys/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>Two Plumbers</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/10/22/two-plumbers/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In a land far away, there were two brothers, two plumbers. To preserve their anonymity, we'll call them... Mario and Luigi. Their mother, a kind and friendly woman, and their father, a man with (by the laws of averages and genetics) a truly gargantuan moustache, raised them both to be kind and friendly (and moustachioed) in their turn. There was enough work in the town to keep both the plumbers busy, and they each grew through apprentice to journeyman to experience and everyone liked them. They both cared about the job, about their clients, and they each did good work, always going the extra mile, doing more than was necessarily asked for, putting in an extra hour to tighten that pipe or fit a better S-bend or clean up the poor workmanship of lesser craftsmen and cowboys. They were happy. Even their rivalry for each job was good-humoured, a friendly source of amusement to them and to the town. Sometimes people would flip a coin to choose which to ring, having no way to choose between them, and Mario would laugh and suggest that he should have two-headed coins made, or Luigi would laugh and say that that ought to make it his turn next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there came a time of downturn, when the people of the town had to hold tighter to their purses, and fewer called out for plumbers. And Luigi, after much thought, decided to take a job with Bowser's, the big plumbing conglomerate from the city. He was worried: the big company were often slapdash or inexperienced in their work, and discourteous or evasive to their clients, and more interested in bottom lines than hot water lines. But they paid extremely well, and they had the latest tools, and there was security in having a contract and a title and a boss. Besides, Bowser's worked for so many more people that Luigi's own skills could only help that many more. Maybe he could even teach them something about quality, and craftsmanship, and care. He suggested to Mario that they both joined, and Mario thought hard about it, and eventually decided not to, though it was a close-run thing. Both the brothers shook hands on it, respecting one another's decision, although in the silence of their hearts each was a little disappointed in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi did well at Bowser's. He was right about the latest tools, and about the pay, and about the security. And he was partially right about teaching the big company something about quality. His work was often better than his colleagues, sometimes through expertise but most often because he tried harder: he loved the work, and wanted to do well, and was kind and friendly when he could be. But sometimes, try though he might, the time wasn't there, or the parts weren't in the van, and these things were not his fault; someone else at the big company had cut corners on their job and that forced Luigi to cut corners on his and make people sad and angry, or put in more time to fix it than he would have spent doing it all correctly himself in the first place. He pushed hard inside the company to fix these things, and he had some successes; a policy was written suggesting that employees work harder to improve customer happiness, and many customers across the land were made a little happier as a result. Luigi won an award. He trained some apprentices, and many of his little ways of making people happier and the job better were adopted into the company training scheme. One time he went home after another argument with his boss about the things that were not adopted, and that night he looked enviously out of their window at his brother's house across the street, thinking that it would be a fine thing to not have a boss who stopped you from doing things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario did well working for himself. The time of downturn ended and things began to pick up again, maybe not quite to where they had been but nearly there for all that, and the phone calls and messages came in once more. Everyone was pleased to see him, and although he maybe took a little longer than the men from the big company, his work was never slapdash, always taking the time to do it right. And he had less money, but he really didn't mind, or begrudge it; he had enough to get by, and he loved the work, and wanted to do well, and was kind and friendly. He did envy his brother's toolbox, though, all the latest gear while Mario himself made do with things a little older, a little rustier, but they were all good quality tools that he understood, and the work was as good and better. In November one year a very expensive plumber's inspection camera was stolen from his brother's van, and Mario thought that it would have been great to have such a thing and maybe he would have taken better care, and then he felt guilty about thinking that of his brother. He felt guiltier still when on Christmas morning he opened the box from Luigi to find an expensive inspection camera in it. But then his brother winked at him and put a finger to his lips, and all was well between them again. One time Mario was up to his waist in the drain outside a house, raindrops rattling on his hat and cursing the god who invented backflow, when he saw his brother drive past all unknowing in his modern van, windows wound up and singing along with the radio, and he looked enviously after the van's lights in the storm, thinking that it would be a fine thing to have just a notch more comfort and influence and two fewer wet knees.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2024-10-22:/days/2024/10/22/two-plumbers/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>On iOS, Home Screen web apps are part of your iCloud Backup</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/09/17/on-ios-home-screen-web-apps-are-part-of-your-icloud-backup/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been most baffled by how on my iPhone, my iCloud backup was over 5GB (and therefore would not back up into the free space that I have) despite how I had turned off most of the apps that might want to be included in the backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many, many, many posts on the internet from people having this problem, and there are a few common things which come up. The first one is that iMessage is included in the backup, and this includes any images or videos you've received or sent. The second is that your photos are included. So if you're thinking "hey there's hardly anything on my phone, why is the iCloud backup so big" but you've got 2 years worth of chats with a zillion people full of videos... that's why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, however, had tried all that and I still couldn't get the backup size down. I even spoke to Apple suport directly about it, three times; each of the people I spoke to had helpful suggestions, but it was also equally clear that each of them was fishing around in the dark, because all the "usual" tricks and traps they knew about which caused this were things that I'd already dealt with or disabled. It all ended up inconclusive, and I still didn't have a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in desperation, I decided to try backing up the phone to my Linux machine so I could poke about in the backup to see if I could tell what was using all the space. Now, iPhones can be backed up to Macs (not surprisingly) and Windows, but there's no official provision for doing so on Linux, sadly. However, there is &lt;a href="https://libimobiledevice.org/"&gt;libimobiledevice&lt;/a&gt;, a set of command line tools. I used them to back up my phone to my desktop as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plug the phone in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;idevicebackup2 cloud off&lt;/code&gt; # disable iCloud backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;idevicebackup2 -i encryption on&lt;/code&gt; # enter a password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;idevicebackup2 backup ./&lt;/code&gt; # back up phone into current dir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I'd done that, I had a folder named for the UDID of my phone, filled with encrypted data. Fortunately, there is a Python library called &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/iOSbackup/"&gt;iOSbackup&lt;/a&gt; which knows how to read and decrypt these backups, so I used it to write myself a little equivalent of the &lt;code&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; utility to see which folders in the backup might be unexpectedly using a lot more storage than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact there were a whole bunch of folders called something like &lt;code&gt;Library/WebClips/(long string).webclip/&lt;/code&gt; which were using &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of storage, some over a gigabyte. I immediately thought: hey, I bet they're Home Screen web apps. I use a lot of these -- if there's a PWA for a service, I'll use it rather than a platform-specific app. We set up &lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org"&gt;Open Web Advocacy&lt;/a&gt; for a reason, after all. So this made me jump to a (what turned out to be correct) conclusion from a standing start. Each of these &lt;code&gt;Library/WebClips/blah.webclip&lt;/code&gt; folders contains an &lt;code&gt;ApplicationManifest&lt;/code&gt; file, and you can get &lt;code&gt;iOSbackup&lt;/code&gt; to disgorge its decrypted content; it's a "binary plist" (which Python &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/plistlib.html"&gt;knows how to read&lt;/a&gt;) and with that I could see which Home Screen web apps were taking up space with this little script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;iOSbackup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;iOSbackup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plistlib&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;UDID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ENTER YOUR UDID HERE (the backup folder name)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;BACKUP ENCRYPTION PASSWORD&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this helpfully printed a list which looked like this (but longer; I've kept a few around to give you the flavour):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://elk.zone/: 133.1MB
https://squoosh.app/: 1.1MB
https://www.kryogenix.org/farmbound/: 11.5MB
https://nerdlegame.com/: 220.9MB
https://twitter.com/: 1.2GB
Phanpy: 1.6GB
https://www.nytimes.com/games/: 376.2MB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... aha. Twitter and Phanpy can, I suppose, be excused since they are presumably caching every post ever, but I can delete those and re-add (and not bother re-adding Twitter) to get some of that back. Wordle, you are the weakest link, goodbye, and also I don't need elk.zone any more now I'm using Phanpy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed a bunch of these. Then I told the iCloud Backup to run again. And now my backup size is 800MB, not 5GB. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, &lt;strong&gt;this is not at all a Safari problem&lt;/strong&gt;. Safari is absolutely doing the right thing here; well done Safari team. Web apps are apps; they should be included in my phone backup, 100%. The bug here is in the iCloud Backup Settings App List, which lists all the apps that are taking up space in the backup but &lt;em&gt;does not list Home Screen web apps&lt;/em&gt;. This sucks, and it's a bug, and it should be fixed. Show me PWAs in the backup list, especially ones taking up a gigabyte of space in it. I have filed the bug at &lt;a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/15158244"&gt;feedbackassistant.apple.com&lt;/a&gt; although I've never heard back from any of the others I've filed there so I don't really know what the process is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now off to add Phanpy again.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 22:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2024-09-17:/days/2024/09/17/on-ios-home-screen-web-apps-are-part-of-your-icloud-backup/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>The CMA wants your comments on web apps</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/08/21/the-cma-wants-your-comments-on-web-apps/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the tl;dr: if you make web apps in or for the UK, the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;CMA&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the UK tech regulator, want to hear from you about their proposals &lt;strong&gt;before August 29th 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, which is only a week away. Read &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66b484020808eaf43b50dea8/Working_paper_7_Potential_Remedies_8.8.24.pdf"&gt;their list of remedies&lt;/a&gt; to anticompetitive behaviour between web browsers and platforms, and email your thoughts to &lt;a href="mailto:browsersandcloud@cma.gov.uk"&gt;browsersandcloud@cma.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; before the deadline. They really do want to hear from you, confidentally if you want, and your voice is useful here; you don't need to have some formally written legal opinion here. They want to hear from actual web devs and companies. Email them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming#contact"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/cma-hear-from-you.png" alt="We want to hear from you -- Competition and Markets Authority"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at what the CMA have written in a little more detail. (This is the "tl" bit, although hopefully you will choose to "r".) They have been conducting a "Market Investigation Reference", which is regulator code for "talk to loads of people to see if there's a problem and then decide what to do about that", and the one we care about is about web browsers. I have, as part of &lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org"&gt;Open Web Advocacy&lt;/a&gt;, been part of those consultations a number of times, and they've always been very willing to listen, and they do seem to identify a bunch of problems with browser diversity that I personally also think are problems. You know what we're talking about here: all browsers on iOS are required to be Safari's WebKit and not their own engine; Google have a tight grip on a whole bunch of stuff; browser diversity is a good thing and there's not enough of it in the world and this looks to be from deliberate attempts to act like monopolies by some players. These are the sorts of issues that CMA are concerned about (and they have published &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming#working-papers"&gt;quite a few working papers explaining their issues in detail&lt;/a&gt; which you can read). What we're looking at today is their proposed list of &lt;em&gt;fixes&lt;/em&gt; for these problems, which they call "remedies". At OWA we have also done this, of course, and you should &lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-browser-and-cloud-investigation-may-fail-to-allow-web-app-competition/"&gt;read the OWA blog post about the CMA's remedies paper&lt;/a&gt;. But the first important point is, to be clear, that a whole bunch of these remedies being proposed by the CMA are &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not a complaint that it's all bad or that it's toothless, not at all. They're going to stop the #AppleBrowserBan and require that other browsers are allowed to use their own engines on iOS as browser apps and in in-app browsing, they're going to require both Apple and Google to grant other browsers' access to the same APIs that their own browsers can get at, they've got suggestions in place for how users can choose which browser they use to get past the problem of the "default hotseat" where you get one browser when you buy a phone and never think to change it, they're suggesting that Google open access to WebAPK minting to everyone. All of these help demonopolise the UK market. This is all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/uk-browser-and-cloud-investigation-may-fail-to-allow-web-app-competition/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/stuart-bruce-alex-cma.jpg" alt="Stuart Langridge, Bruce Lawson, and Alex Moore of OWA in the CMA offices in London"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some places where their remedies don't really go far enough, and this is the stuff where it would be good for you, my web-engaged reader, to send them an email with your thoughts one way or the other. Part of making the web as capable as a platform-specific app is that web sites can be presented like a platform-specific app. This is (part of) what a PWA is, which most of you reading this will already know about. But releasing your app as a PWA, while it has a bunch of good characteristics for you (no reviews needed, instant updates, full control, cross-platform development, no tithing of money required to the people who sold the phone it's on) also has some downsides. In particular, it's difficult to get people to "install" a PWA, especially on iOS where you have to tell your users to go digging around in the share menu. And this is a fairly big area where the CMA could have proposed remedies, and have so far not chosen to. The first problem here is that iOS Safari doesn't support any sort of install prompt: as mentioned, there's the "add to home screen" entry hidden in the share menu. There's an API for this, everyone else implements it, iOS Safari doesn't. Maybe the API's got problems and needs fixing? That seems fine; engage with the web standards process to get it fixed! But there's been no sign of doing that in any useful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second and related issue is that although the CMA's remedies state that browsers can use their own engine rather than having to be mere wrappers around the platform's web view, they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say that when a browser installs a web app, that that web app will &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; use that browser's engine. That is: if there were a port of, say, Microsoft Edge to iOS, then Edge would be able to use its own engine, which is Microsoft's port of Blink. That Edge browser can implement install prompts how it likes, because it's using its own engine. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; there's no guarantee in the CMA remedies that the PWA that gets &lt;em&gt;installed&lt;/em&gt; will then be opened up in Edge. Calling the "install this PWA as an app" API provided by the platform might add it as a PWA &lt;em&gt;in the platform maker's browser&lt;/em&gt; -- iOS Safari in this example. This would be rubbish. It means that the installed app might not even work; how will it know your passwords or cookies, etc; this can't be what's intended. But the remedies do not explicitly state this requirement, and so it's quite possible that platform owners will therefore use this as another way to push back against PWAs to make them less of a competitor to their own app stores. I would like to be able to say that platform owners wouldn't do that, that they wouldn't deliberately make things worse in an effort at malicious compliance, but after the debacle earlier this year of &lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/"&gt;Apple dropping PWA support entirely&lt;/a&gt; and then only &lt;a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apple-backs-off-killing-web-apps/"&gt;backing off on that after public outcry&lt;/a&gt;, we can't assume that there will be a good-faith attempt to improve PWA support (either by implementation, or by engaging wholeheartedly with the public web standards process), and so the remedies need to spell this out in more detail. This should be easy enough if I'm right and the CMA's &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is that this should be done, and your voice adding to that is likely to encourage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdaRoseCannon/status/1389642353472851970"&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/ada-apple-tweet.png" alt="A tweet from Ada Rose Cannon reading 'Seeing a Web App I worked on used by *Apple* to justify that the Web is a viable platform on iOS is bullshit. The Web can be an ideal place to build apps but Apple is consistently dragging their heals on implementing the Web APIs that would allow them to compete with native apps', quoting a tweet by Peter Gasston with text 'This image from Apple‘s opening presentation in the Epic Games court case is very misleading. “Web Apps and Native Apps can look the same, therefore no-one needs to publish on the App Store”.' and an Apple-created image of the FT web app and FT platform-specific app looking similar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry about malicious compliance hampering web apps being a proper competitor to platform-specific apps also extends to another thing missing in the remedies: that access to hardware and software platform APIs for other browsers isn't required to be "which APIs there are", but "which APIs the existing browser elects to use". That is: if you write a native platform-specific app, it can talk to various hardware-ish things; bluetooth, USB, NFC, whichever. Therefore, you ought to be able, if you're a browser, to also have those APIs, in enough detail that you can then offer (mediated, secure) access to those services to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; users, the PWAs and websites that people run with you. But the remedies do not ensure that this is the case; they ensure that there is a "requirement for Apple to grant equivalent access to APIs used by WebKit and Safari to browsers using alternative browser engines." What this means is that if Safari doesn't use a thing, no other browser can use it either. So it's not possible to make the browser you build &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than Safari at this; Apple get to set the ceiling of what the web can do on the platform, and the ceiling is defined as "whatever &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; browser can do". That's... not very competitive, is it? No. If you agree with that, then you should also write to the CMA about it. They would like to hear about actual examples where this sort of thing harms UK businesses, of course, and if that's you definitely write in, but it's also worth giving your opinion if you are a UK developer who works in this area, delivering things via the web to your users (or if you want to do that but are currently prevented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Discussion over: go and write to the CMA with your thoughts on their remedies. Even if you think what they've proposed is perfect, you should still send them a message saying that; one thing that they and all government agencies tend to bemoan is that they only hear from people with lots of skin in the game, and generally only from people who are opposed, not people who are supportive. That means that they get a skewed view of what the web developer community actually &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;, and this is a chance for us to unskew that a bit, together. You can request that the CMA keep your name, business, or submission confidential, so you don't have to worry about giving away secrets or your participation, and you need only comment on stuff which is relevant to you; you do not need a comprehensive position paper on the whole thing! The address to email is &lt;a href="mailto:browsersandcloud@cma.gov.uk"&gt;browsersandcloud@cma.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;, the list of remedies is &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66b484020808eaf43b50dea8/Working_paper_7_Potential_Remedies_8.8.24.pdf"&gt;Working Paper 7&lt;/a&gt;, and the deadline is &lt;strong&gt;Thursday 29th August&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to hear more about this, then I am &lt;a href="https://2024.stateofthebrowser.com/speaker/stuart-langridge/"&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt; about OWA, how it happened, what we've done, and how you can be involved at &lt;a href="https://2024.stateofthebrowser.com/"&gt;State of the Browser 2024&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 14th September (just under a month from now!) in the Barbican in London. I'm &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/londonwebstandards.org/post/3l2a2uqy5432s"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that there are less than 30 in-person tickets left, although there are online streaming tickets available too, so get in quick if you want to hear me and a whole bunch of other speakers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Late breaking update: &lt;a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2024/web-apps-on-ios-is-the-cma-missing-the-point/"&gt;Bruce has also written about this&lt;/a&gt; and you should read that too!)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 09:07:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2024-08-21:/days/2024/08/21/the-cma-wants-your-comments-on-web-apps/</guid><category>General musings</category></item><item><title>Family Fortunes board generator</title><link>https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2024/08/19/family-fortunes-board-generator/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I nerd-sniped myself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Internet: I am disappointed that you have not provided me with one of those meme-maker websites for a Family Fortunes board. Now I will have to make one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, I put word to thought and that was my mistake. So I spent, like, half my Saturday doing this instead of what I should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/family-fortunes/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/random/ff.png" alt="A Family Fortunes board from the 1980s reading 'Things I should have done instead of this' with options 'SoTB talk', 'Ironing', 'Lagers', 'D&amp;amp;D campaign', and 'touching grass' in air-quotes (with a score of 0)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to use a couple of interesting techniques with it that I hadn't done before, now that nice new web APIs exist for them: sharing an image, for example, which involves creating a &lt;code&gt;Blob&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67073474/1418014"&gt;thank you Thomas Steiner&lt;/a&gt;), doing the equivalent of the venerable "yellow fade technique" with the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API"&gt;web animations API&lt;/a&gt;, and yoinking all the information from a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; conveniently by reading &lt;code&gt;new FormData(form)&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;form.oninput&lt;/code&gt;. This is all cool stuff; the web's such a nice environment to program for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of people have pointed out that this is not emulating the particular style of Family Fortunes board that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; prefer, to which our survey says: feel free to make your own. This is the one &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; grew up with; those of you of more venerable years who prefer Max Bygraves or Bob Monkhouse to Les Dennis will simply have to struggle on under the burden. (Let us not speak of the appalling colourful modern video wall, which is just literally no fun at all and looks like a pub quiz machine.) Also, it turns out that Quite A Lot Of People have Opinions on what the exact shape of the X's should be, and no two of these opinions are the same. All good clean fun, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can't think that this is ever likely to be all that important, but if you ever need a way to mock up a Family Fortunes&lt;sup id="sf-family-fortunes-board-generator-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-family-fortunes-board-generator-1" class="simple-footnote" title="I think Americans call it Family Feud?"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; screen from the 1980s with your own custom answers and scores, we asked 100 people and they all said that &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/family-fortunes/"&gt;kryogenix.org/code/family-fortunes&lt;/a&gt; is right there waiting patiently for you. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-family-fortunes-board-generator-1"&gt;I think Americans call it Family Feud? &lt;a href="#sf-family-fortunes-board-generator-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 16:22:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2024-08-19:/days/2024/08/19/family-fortunes-board-generator/</guid><category>General musings</category></item></channel></rss>
