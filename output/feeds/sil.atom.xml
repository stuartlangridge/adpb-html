That is: I wanted to be able to say, here is a template string, please substitute a bunch of variables into it. Now, Python already does this, in about &lt;a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating"&gt;thirty different ways&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting"&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings"&gt;&lt;code&gt;string.Template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; do most of it as built-in. (&lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt; lets you do this: &lt;code&gt;"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old".format(name="Stuart", age=43)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;string.Template&lt;/code&gt; thus: &lt;code&gt;t=string.Template("My name is $name and I am $age years old").safe_substitute(name="Stuart", age=43)&lt;/code&gt;, both of which are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what they&amp;#8217;re missing is loops; having more than one of a thing in your template, and looping over a list, substituting it each time. Every even fractionally-more-featureful templating system has this, whether &lt;a href="http://mustache.github.io/"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/"&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; or whatever, of course, but I didn&amp;#8217;t want another dependency. All I needed was &lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt; but with loops. So, I thought, I&amp;#8217;ll write one, in about four lines of code, so I can just drop the function in to my Python file and then I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;loophandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;groupdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;var&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;\{loop (?P&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;[^}]+)\}(?P&amp;lt;content&amp;gt;.*?)\{endloop\}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="n"&gt;loophandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DOTALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And lo, twas so. So I can now&amp;nbsp;do &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I am {name} and my imps&amp;#39; names are: {loop imps}{name}{endloop}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Stuart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;imps&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Pyweazle&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Grimthacket&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hardebon&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and it all works. Not revolutionary, of course, but I was mildly pleased with&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much internal debate about whether &lt;code&gt;loophandler()&lt;/code&gt; should have been a &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;, but I eventually decided it was more confusing that way, on the grounds that it was confusing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and I knew what it was meant to be&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation: &lt;code&gt;re.sub&lt;/code&gt; lets you pass a function as the thing to replace with, rather than just a string. So we find all examples of &lt;code&gt;{loop something}...{endloop}&lt;/code&gt; in the passed string, look up &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; in the &amp;#8220;context&amp;#8221;, or the dict of substitution variables you passed to &lt;code&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/code&gt;, and then we call &lt;code&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, once per item in &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; (which is expected to be a list), and pass it the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; as its string and the next item in &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; as its context. So it all works. Of course, there&amp;#8217;s no error handling or anything &amp;#8212; if &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t present in the context, or if it&amp;#8217;s not a list, or if you stray in any other way from the path of righteousness, it&amp;#8217;ll incomprehensibly blow up. So don&amp;#8217;t do&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Brum tech pub crawl 2019</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/12/19/brum-tech-pub-crawl-2019/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-19T15:35:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-19T15:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2019-12-19:/days/2019/12/19/brum-tech-pub-crawl-2019/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for the Birmingham tech pub crawl!

&lt;p&gt;This is called a pub crawl, but it&amp;#8217;s really an excuse to get together, hang out, have a couple of drinks &amp;#8212; alcoholic or not, that&amp;#8217;s entirely up to you and there&amp;#8217;s no pressure &amp;#8212; in various places around the Jewellery Quarter. (There was discussion of being in the city centre, or in Digbeth, but since it&amp;#8217;s a Saturday and we want to talk rather than scream over the music, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JQ&lt;/span&gt; it is.) Get away from the turkey and chill out and meet people. Bring your family and your friends along. Pop in for an hour while you&amp;#8217;re in town and say hello, or show up at 12 noon and still be there at midnight, it&amp;#8217;s up to you. Lots of people come at various points during the day, and it&amp;#8217;s all very friendly, so if you don&amp;#8217;t think you know anyone, or you&amp;#8217;re on your own, that&amp;#8217;s not a problem. Come, chat to people, have a drink, have a laugh. The agenda this year is, roughly, six different places and a couple of hours in each, so we move around a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s all in the Jewellery Quarter so there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of walking. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling unsure do feel free to ping me &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sil"&gt;@sil&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter &amp;#8212; and I can tell you where we are, and I&amp;#8217;ll try to keep things updated during the&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is welcome, and everyone is invited. Bring friends along; drink coffees or soft drinks; pop in for an hour; whatever you fancy. Tell everyone about your pressies, talk about all the tech you thought about over the Christmas period, or don&amp;#8217;t talk about technology at all and just enjoy hanging out with your mates. Looking forward to seeing you&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough&amp;nbsp;agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lord Clifden, 12pm - 2pm (they do food if you fancy&amp;nbsp;lunch)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Church, 2pm -&amp;nbsp;4pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1000 Trades, 4pm -&amp;nbsp;6pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Rose Villa Tavern, 6pm - 8pm (probably grab a bite to eat here if we haven&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;already)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Queen&amp;#8217;s Arms, 8pm -&amp;nbsp;10pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Actress and Bishop, 10pm -&amp;nbsp;whenever&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s from The Official Slacker Handbook by Sarah Dunn, which I painstakingly tracked down and purchased a second-hand paper copy of to find this, and it&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Order of Illuminati, killed George Washington and served himself as our first president for two terms. The Illuminati are ultimately responsible for the French Revolution, the Bolshevik revolution, the American Revolution, the Pope, the Kennedy assassination, the Manson family, the Rockefeller dynasty, the numbers 5, 17, and 23, the New Age movement, the Nazis, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFO&lt;/span&gt; visitations, the Universal Price Code, and the pyramid with the eye on the back of the dollar bill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No comment on whether I believe any of this, but of course that&amp;#8217;s just what they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; you to think.&amp;nbsp;Fnord.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Three HomeSignal femtocell for bad coverage</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/04/29/three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-29T09:46:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-29T09:46:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2019-04-29:/days/2019/04/29/three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My flat has terrible mobile coverage.

You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;but Stuart! you live right in the centre of Birmingham! surely coverage in a city centre would be amazing!&lt;/em&gt; at which point you will get a look like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/john-oliver-look-to-camera.gif" alt=":|"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then I will say, &lt;em&gt;yeah, it’s something to do with the buildings or concrete or something, it’s fine when you’re outside. It’s an old building. Maybe they put copper in the walls like in the Rookery or something.&lt;/em&gt; Anyway, whatever, it never worked, regardless of which operator you’re on. So, when I moved in, I contacted &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; operator, Three, and said: this sucks, do something about it. They said, sure thing, install our Wi-Fi Calling app, Three in-Touch. Which I did, and managed for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “managed” because that app is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is clunky, it doesn’t handle picture messages, there’s no way to mark a message read, the phone call quality cuts out and breaks all the time, and most annoyingly when you get an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; it shows a notification but doesn’t play a sound, so I have no idea that I &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; a notification&lt;sup id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-1" class="simple-footnote" title="They have had, looking at the internet, this reported to them about six hundred billion times"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I’ve missed &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; of SMSes over the last couple of years because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Three In-Touch&lt;sup id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-2" class="simple-footnote" title="they don’t seem to be anything like consistent about the spelling and punctuation of the name of this app, so I don’t see why I should be either"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; app popped up a little dialogue box last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/threeintouchdialog.png" alt="We are updating our network. From 15 May 2019, the Three inTouch app will no longer be supported. Your call history and SMS sent or received will remain visible but you will no longer be able to make calls or send or receive SMS through the app. If you delete the app, your call and SMS history will be lost. WiFi calling is already built into most handsets these days and will continue to work in any enabled handset without need of the app"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, thought I. WiFi calling is already built in, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there’s a problem with that. On iOS it’s built in. On Android, on a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of phones, it’s built in &lt;em&gt;only if you bought the phone from your carrier&lt;/em&gt;, which I never do. It needs some special bit of config built into the firmware for wifi calling to work.&lt;sup id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-3-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-3" class="simple-footnote" title="It seems like this might be fixed in very recent versions of Android? It’s not at all clear. This problem is of course exacerbated by not getting system updates unless your phone is less than a week old."&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So I thought, well, I’m screwed then. Because Three won’t update my Z5 Compact to have whatever firmware it needs to do wifi calling, they’ve killed the (execrable, but functional) app, and I’m not buying a new phone until the phone industry stops making them the size of a football pitch.&lt;sup id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-4-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-4" class="simple-footnote" title="I saw a bloke on Twitter the other day say rather sneerily, I bet all the people who are mocking folding phones like the Samsung Fold now also mocked the Samsung Note until they realised they like big screens after all. No, sneery bloke. I mock the folding phones now for being a (terribly clever technical) solution in search of a problem, I hated the huge Note when it first came out, and I hate all huge phones now. For god’s sake, phone industry, make a small flagship phone. Just one. I suppose it’ll have to be an Xperia Compact again, but it’d be good if there were competition for it."&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I got on the live chat thing with Three, who (predictably) said, yeah, we’re not sending you the firmware, pull the other one, son, it’s got bells on.&lt;sup id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-5-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-5" class="simple-footnote" title="They also said that they’re rebuilding the Three inTouch app to be good and work with 5G. Apparently. At some unknown point in the future. I carefully did not point out that if you’re building a replacement for something then there needs to be overlap between the two things rather than an interregnum during which every user is screwed, because that information needs to go to their project manager rather than their support team, but to be clear: to whichever project manager thinks this is an acceptable way to do deployments, I hope someone hides snakes in your car."&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, a surprise. Because they said, howsabout we send you a &lt;a href="https://three.co.uk/homesignal"&gt;Three HomeSignal&lt;/a&gt; device? It’s a box that plugs into your wifi and then your phone sees it as a phone antenna and you get good coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my brain went, what, a femtocell? A femtocell like I asked you about when I first started having coverage problems and you swore blind didn’t exist because everyone has wifi calling now? One of those femtocells?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been taught to never look a gift femtocell in the mouth, though, I didn’t say anything except “yes please I’d like that, cheers very much”. And so it arrived in the post two days later. Result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the user guide leaves a bit to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/threehomesignaluserguide.png" alt="The Three HomeSignal user guide, which says to plug in the ethernet cable and the power, and does not at all mention that it also needs a SIM card"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know why the user guide completely ignores that you need to also plug a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card into the HomeSignal device, but it does in fact ignore that. You should not ignore it: you need to do it, otherwise it doesn’t work; you’ll get an error, which is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; flashing red five times, which means (in the only mention of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; anywhere in the user guide) “&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card problem”. At which point you think: what bloody &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More confusingly still, Three include &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; cards in the package. One is a Pay as you Go &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the one you want. I don’t know why the hell they put that in; fine, if you wanna sell me on your products, go for it, but you made the HomeSignal process a billion times more confusing. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card that goes into the HomeSignal device is on a special green card, and it says “HomeSignal device only” on it. Put that one in the HomeSignal box. The other one, the Pay as you Go one, you should sellotape it to a brick and then send it back to Three, postage on delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, it works. So, Three, if you’re listening: one bonus point for finally deciding to update the awful Three in Touch app. Minus twenty points for not having a replacement for people who didn’t buy phones from you. Plus another twenty points for offering me the Three HomeSignal femtocell which fixes my problem. Minus a little bit for the bad instructions which don’t say that I have to put a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card in, and then minus quite a lot more for putting &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; cards in the box when I do finally work that out! So, on balance, this is probably about neutral; they have fixed a problem I shouldn’t have and which is partially caused by phone manufacturers, using a technically very clever solution which was confusingly explained. Business as usual in the mobile phone world, I suppose, unless you’re using an Apple phone at which point everything works really smoothly until it suddenly doesn’t. One day someone will get all of this right, surely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-1"&gt;They have had, looking at the internet, this reported to them about six hundred billion times &lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-2"&gt;they don’t seem to be anything like consistent about the spelling and punctuation of the name of this app, so I don’t see why I should be either &lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-3"&gt;It seems like this might be fixed in very recent versions of Android? It’s not at all clear. This problem is of course exacerbated by not getting system updates unless your phone is less than a week old. &lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-4"&gt;I saw a bloke on Twitter the other day say rather sneerily, I bet all the people who are mocking folding phones like the Samsung Fold now also mocked the Samsung Note until they realised they like big screens after all. No, sneery bloke. I mock the folding phones now for being a (terribly clever technical) solution in search of a problem, I hated the huge Note when it first came out, and I hate all huge phones now. For god’s sake, phone industry, make a small flagship phone. Just one. I suppose it’ll have to be an Xperia Compact again, but it’d be good if there were competition for it. &lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-5"&gt;They also said that they’re rebuilding the Three inTouch app to be good and work with 5G. Apparently. At some unknown point in the future. I carefully did not point out that if you’re building a replacement for something then there needs to be overlap between the two things rather than an interregnum during which every user is screwed, because that information needs to go to their project manager rather than their support team, but to be clear: to whichever project manager thinks this is an acceptable way to do deployments, I hope someone hides snakes in your car. &lt;a href="#sf-three-homesignal-femtocell-for-bad-coverage-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The ray-traced pictures</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/04/01/the-ray-traced-pictures/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-01T16:41:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-01T16:41:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2019-04-01:/days/2019/04/01/the-ray-traced-pictures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A two-decade-long search is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I wrote up the efforts required to &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/08/24/double-oh-seven/"&gt;recover a tiny sound demo for the Archimedes computer&lt;/a&gt;. In there, I made brief mention of a sample from an Arc sound editor named Armadeus, of a man saying &amp;#8220;the mask, the ray-traced pictures, and finally the wire-frame city&amp;#8221;. That wasn&amp;#8217;t an idle comment. &lt;a href="http://whizzy.org"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; and I have been looking for that sample for twenty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re thinking, I bet it&amp;#8217;s not been twenty years. And you would be wrong. &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/comp.sys.acorn.misc/3YhswrNrGSo/discussion"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Bill posting to &lt;code&gt;comp.sys.acorn&lt;/code&gt; in 2003&lt;/a&gt;, for a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter knows about this sample. &lt;a href="http://jonobacon.com"&gt;Jono&lt;/a&gt; knows about it. I use the phrase as a microphone test sentence, the same way other people use &amp;#8220;testing, testing, 1, 2&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s lived in my head since I was in middle school, there on the Arc machines in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL0&lt;/span&gt;, which was Computer Lab Zero. (There was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt;, which had the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; Micros in it, on the first floor. I never did know whether &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL0&lt;/span&gt;, which was on the ground floor, was a subtle joke about floor levels and computers&amp;#8217; zero-based numbering schemes, or if Mr Irons the teacher was just weird. He might have been weird. He thought the name for an exclamation mark was&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;pling&amp;#8221;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we got to talking about it again, and Bill said: to hell with this, I&amp;#8217;ll just buy Armadeus. This act of selfless heroism earns him a gold medal. And a pint, yes it does. I&amp;#8217;ll let him tell the story about that, and the mindblowing worthlessness of modern floppy drives, in his own time. But today it arrived, and now I have an&amp;nbsp;mp3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio src="https://kryogenix.org/random/themask.mp3" controls&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/random/themask.mp3"&gt;The ray-traced pictures. The mask. And finally, the wire-frame city.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I thought it was in the other order. The sample actually says: &amp;#8220;The ray-traced pictures. The mask. And finally, the wire-frame city.&amp;#8221; I thought &amp;#8220;the mask&amp;#8221; was first, and it isn&amp;#8217;t. Still, memory plays tricks on you after this many years. Apparently it&amp;#8217;s from a Clares sound and music demo originally (Clares were the (defunct) company that made Armadeus. The name appears to have risen from the dead a couple of times since. No idea who they are now, if anyone.) Anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t care; I&amp;#8217;ve got it now. And it&amp;#8217;s on my website, which means it will never go away. We found it once before and then lost the sample; I&amp;#8217;m not making the same mistake again. Is this how Indy felt when he found the&amp;nbsp;Ark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a shout out to &lt;a href="http://arcem.sourceforge.net/"&gt;arcem&lt;/a&gt;, which is an Archimedes emulator which runs fine on Ubuntu. It&amp;#8217;s a pain in the bum to set up &amp;#8212; you have to compile it, find ROMs, turn on sound support, use weird keypresses, set up hard drives in an incomprehensible text file, etc; someone ought to snap it or something so it&amp;#8217;s easier &amp;#8212; but it&amp;#8217;s been rather nice revisiting a lot of the &lt;a href="http://www.apdl.org.uk/apdlpd/library/library.htm"&gt;Arc software&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s still collected and around for download. Desktop sillies. Someone should bring desktop sillies back to modern desktops. And reconnecting to &lt;a href="http://arcade-bbs.net"&gt;Arcade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who need to fix all their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTP&lt;/span&gt; links to point to &lt;code&gt;telnet.arcade-bbs.net&lt;/code&gt; rather than the now-dead &lt;code&gt;arcade.demon.co.uk&lt;/code&gt;. I got to watch !DeskDuck again, which was a small mallard duck that swum up and down along the top of your icon bar. And a bunch of old demos from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIA&lt;/span&gt; and Arcangel and so on. I&amp;#8217;d forgotten a bit how much I liked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RISC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and in particular that it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;so fast&lt;/em&gt; to start up. Bring that&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;

So if you’re in the area, do drop by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best to not talk about politics right now. It was bad two years ago and it’s worse now. We’re currently in the teeth of Brexit. I thought this below from Jon Worth was a useful summary of what the next steps are, but this is no long-term thing; this shows what might happen in the next few days, which is as far out as can be planned. I have no idea what I’ll be thinking when writing my birthday post next year. I’m pretty worried.&lt;/p&gt;

Get away from the turkey and chill out and meet people. Bring your family and your friends along. Pop in for an hour while you&amp;#8217;re in town and say hello, or show up at 12 noon and still be there at midnight, it&amp;#8217;s up to you. Lots of people come at various points during the day, and it&amp;#8217;s all very friendly, so if you don&amp;#8217;t think you know anyone, or you&amp;#8217;re on your own, that&amp;#8217;s not a problem. Come, chat to people, have a drink, have a laugh. The agenda this year is, roughly, six different places and a couple of hours in each, so we move around a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s all in the Jewellery Quarter so there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of walking. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling unsure do feel free to ping me &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sil"&gt;@sil&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter &amp;#8212; and I can tell you where we are, and I&amp;#8217;ll try to keep things updated during the day. Everyone is welcome, and everyone is&amp;nbsp;invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough&amp;nbsp;agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lord Clifden, 12pm - 2pm (they do food if you fancy&amp;nbsp;lunch)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Church, 2pm -&amp;nbsp;4pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1000 Trades, 4pm -&amp;nbsp;6pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Rose Villa Tavern, 6pm - 8pm (probably grab a bite to eat here if we haven&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;already)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Queen&amp;#8217;s Arms, 8pm -&amp;nbsp;10pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Actress and Bishop, 10pm -&amp;nbsp;whenever&lt;/li&gt;

But there&amp;#8217;s one extra argument I&amp;#8217;d like to add to his list; less important than some of the others, but a different&amp;nbsp;nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I find myself doing a bit of extra work to accommodate some users with unusual requirements, I find myself thinking: why isn&amp;#8217;t it their job to fix this, rather than mine? This is an unworthy thought, and I don&amp;#8217;t like that I have it, and I don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;respond&lt;/em&gt; to this thought; doing the right thing so all my users can use my stuff is important. But I do have the thought, nonetheless. Whether I&amp;#8217;m adding aria labels for screenreaders, or doing extra work to build sites that layer behaviour on top as additional rather than critical, or checking text contrast ratios, or testing on unusual mobile phones I don&amp;#8217;t and won&amp;#8217;t have, there&amp;#8217;s a sneaky little bit of my brain saying &amp;#8220;why is this my problem? if someone wants to buy a weird phone, it&amp;#8217;s their problem that websites don&amp;#8217;t work right, isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave aside here, for now, that there is no such thing as a &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; experience, and even saying that people differ from the &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; experience means that you are thinking about things the wrong way because you&amp;#8217;re assuming that there is a normality and then there&amp;#8217;s divergence and that&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I know this. You know this too, or at least&amp;nbsp;should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the secret. Someone who has a web experience different from what the industry perceives as the norm is normally actually pretty happy to try, for themselves, to make their web experience better. Someone with poor motor control generally &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be happy to learn the keyboard shortcuts for their browser, which the &amp;#8220;norm&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t bother to do. Someone who listens to the web rather than reads it generally &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be happy to learn how to skip over your header using an option available in their tool but not yours, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to add &amp;#8220;skip header&amp;#8221; links. Someone who is desperate for all bold text to appear in bright green and with sparkles generally will be happy to learn how to customise their user stylesheet to make that&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is: if you use semantic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, then they do the work, not you. Their browser does the work, not you. If your pages use semantic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, you&amp;#8217;re not going to get bug reports saying that your web app doesn&amp;#8217;t work in a screenreader, or your buttons don&amp;#8217;t work without mouse clicks, or your site doesn&amp;#8217;t show anything on a Yoyodyne SuperPhone 3 running FailBrowser, because it will and they will and it will. And using semantic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; elements is no more effort; it&amp;#8217;s just as easy to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as it is to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="main"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Easier, even. You get to offload some of that work onto the people who need it, and they are happy to do it, as long as you aren&amp;#8217;t actively working to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Print to Google Drive in a non-Gnome desktop</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2018/10/15/print-to-google-drive-in-a-non-gnome-desktop/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-15T23:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-15T23:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2018-10-15:/days/2018/10/15/print-to-google-drive-in-a-non-gnome-desktop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Bicha wrote up an unknown Ubuntu feature: &lt;a href="https://jeremy.bicha.net/2018/10/14/google-cloud-print-in-ubuntu/"&gt;&amp;#8220;printing&amp;#8221; direct to a Google Drive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I rather wanted this, but I don&amp;#8217;t run the Gnome desktop, so I thought I might be out of luck. But no! It works fine on my Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; desktop too. A couple of extra tweaks are required, though. This is unfortunately a bit technical, but it should only need setting up&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the Gnome Control Centre and Gnome Online Accounts installed, if you don&amp;#8217;t have them already, as well as the Google Cloud Print extension that Jeremy mentions. From a terminal, run &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install gnome-control-center gnome-online-accounts cpdb-backend-gcp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to launch the Control Centre, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t like you if you&amp;#8217;re not running the Gnome desktop. So, we lie to it. In that terminal, run &lt;code&gt;XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center online-accounts&lt;/code&gt;. This should correctly start the Control Centre, showing the online accounts. Sign in to your Google account using that window. (I only have Files and Printers selected; you don&amp;#8217;t need Mail and Calendars and so on to get this printing&amp;nbsp;working.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;#8230; it all works. From now on, when you go to print something, the print dialogue will, after a couple of seconds, show a new entry: &amp;#8220;Save to Google Drive&amp;#8221;. Choose that, and your document will &amp;#8220;print&amp;#8221; to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; stored in Google Drive. Easy peasy. Nice one Jeremy for the write-up. It&amp;#8217;d be neat if Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; could integrate this a little more&amp;nbsp;tightly.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Emoji Silhouettes with CSS, a second approach</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2018/08/28/emoji-silhouettes-with-css-a-second-approach/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-28T22:29:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-08-28T22:29:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2018-08-28:/days/2018/08/28/emoji-silhouettes-with-css-a-second-approach/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every now and again it&amp;#8217;s useful to display single-colour emoji on a web page; all the colours in those little emoji symbols are nice and all, but it does occasionally make your formal document look a bit like an angry fruit salad.

I&amp;#8217;ve seen a technique for this before (in particular from &lt;a href="https://www.bram.us/2016/10/06/emoji-silhouettes-and-emoji-outlines-with-css/"&gt;Bram van Damme&lt;/a&gt;, but searching for &amp;#8220;emoji silhouettes&amp;#8221; finds lots of other people doing it too), where you set the text colour to &lt;code&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt; and then set a &lt;code&gt;text-shadow&lt;/code&gt;, and you&amp;#8217;re done. This is nice, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for me in Firefox, sadly; if you set the text &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; to transparent then indeed your emoji disappear, but if you set a text shadow they come right back, and in full&amp;nbsp;colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I do it a different way, akin to the ancient and well-known image replacement method; set a &lt;code&gt;text-indent&lt;/code&gt; on the element containing your emoji and then reverse that text indent in the &lt;code&gt;text-shadow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s &lt;code&gt;offset-x&lt;/code&gt; position. So you set &lt;code&gt;text-indent&lt;/code&gt; to something massive and negative like &lt;code&gt;-2000em&lt;/code&gt; so it&amp;#8217;s definitely off the page to the left, and then a &lt;code&gt;text-shadow&lt;/code&gt; (which, we recall, is &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow"&gt;specified&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;em&gt;text-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius color&lt;/em&gt;) of &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; 2000em to put the text shadow back where the original characters were before they were indented miles to the&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
span.emoji {
    text-indent: -2000em;
    text-shadow: 2000em 0 0 red;
}
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And here are some emoji silhouettes:
    &amp;lt;span class="emoji"&amp;gt;🚀 🎭 &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;.
    Aren't they nice!&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#emojidemo span.emoji {
    text-indent: -2000em;
    text-shadow: 2000em 0 0 red;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 2.5em;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p id="emojidemo"&gt;And here are some emoji silhouettes:
    &lt;span class="emoji"&gt;🚀 🎭 &lt;/span&gt;. 
Aren&amp;#8217;t they&amp;nbsp;nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to wrap your Unicode characters in their own little span, which is a bit unfortunate, but then you have to with other approaches too. (And your span has to be &lt;code&gt;display: inline-block&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; too, otherwise the &lt;code&gt;text-indent&lt;/code&gt; gets ignored.) Anyway, not earth-shattering, but I quite like&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this was originally posted, Garrett LeSage &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garrett/status/1034570594027810816"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; a different approach, using &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; filters&lt;/a&gt;. These are quite a lot more powerful than one might think. His approach applies a set of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; filters in concert, like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the contrast on your emoji to high with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;filter: contrast(0)&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;span style="filter: contrast(0)"&gt;🚀&amp;nbsp;🎭 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a &lt;code&gt;sepia(100%)&lt;/code&gt; filter to colorise: &lt;span style="filter: contrast(0) sepia(100%)"&gt;🚀&amp;nbsp;🎭 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the colour to one of your choice with &lt;code&gt;hue-rotate(180deg)&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;span style="filter: contrast(0) sepia(100%) hue-rotate(180deg)"&gt;🚀&amp;nbsp;🎭 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally pump up the saturation with &lt;code&gt;saturate(1000%)&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;span style="filter: contrast(0) sepia(100%) hue-rotate(180deg) saturate(1000%)"&gt;🚀&amp;nbsp;🎭 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The up-side of this approach is that it&amp;#8217;s one line of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;; you don&amp;#8217;t need to set inline-block, or worry about defining a width on your &amp;#8220;emoji&amp;#8221; element. The down-side is&amp;#8230; well, you may be thinking, &amp;#8220;where do we specify that we want the final colour of the emoji to be &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; in that code above?&amp;#8221; And you would be right. You have to do some &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; maths calculations to actually work out how to set your emoji to the colour you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;. Barrett Sonntag wrote an &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp"&gt;interactive filter generator&lt;/a&gt; to calculate the set of &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;s required to set your colour to the thing you choose, based on some &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42966641/how-to-transform-black-into-any-given-color-using-only-css-filters/43960991#43960991"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; answers. I think this downside is enough to lean me away from this method, personally, but it&amp;#8217;s another approach if you prefer&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
