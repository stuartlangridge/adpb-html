The audience feels like a missing piece of what makes conferences so special. (The more claps and laughs, the more clap and laugh track should be played)&lt;/p&gt;— Nicole Sullivan (@stubbornella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stubbornella/status/1254164566017114112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 25, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a cool idea, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I built &lt;a href="https://stuartlangridge.github.io/remote-applause/"&gt;Remote Applause&lt;/a&gt;, which does exactly that. Give your session a name, and it gives you a page to be the “stage”, and a link to send to everyone in the “audience”. The audience link has “clap” and “laugh” buttons; when anyone presses one, your stage page plays the sound of a laughter track or applause. Quite neat for an afternoon hack, so I thought I’d talk about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it’s all driven by WebRTC data connections. WebRTC is notoriously difficult to get right, but fortunately &lt;a href="https://peerjs.com/"&gt;PeerJS&lt;/a&gt; exists which does most of the heavy lifting.&lt;sup id="sf-remote-applause-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-remote-applause-1" class="simple-footnote" title="but it requires javascript! Aren’t you always going on about that, Stuart? Well, yes. However, it’s flat-out not possible to do real-time two-way communication sanely without it, so I’m OK with requiring JS in this particular case. For your restaurant menu, no."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seemed to be abandoned a few years ago, but they’ve picked it up again since, which is good news. Essentially, the way the thing works is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you name your session, the “stage” page calculates a unique &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; from that name, and registers with that name on PeerJS’s coordination server. The audience page calculates the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-remote-applause-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-remote-applause-2" class="simple-footnote" title="using a quick JS version of Java’s hashCode function, because PeerJS has requirements on ID strings that exclude some of the characters in base64 so I couldn’t use window.btoa(), I didn’t want (or need) a whole hash library, and the  is complex"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, registers itself with a random &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;, and opens a PeerJS data connection to the stage page (because it knows what its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; is). PeerJS is just using WebRTC data connections under the covers, but the PeerJS people provide the signalling server, which the main alternative &lt;a href="https://github.com/feross/simple-peer"&gt;simple-peer&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t, and I didn’t want to have to run a signalling server myself because then I’d need server-side hosting for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience page can then send a “clap” or “laugh” message down that connection whenever the respective button is pressed, and the stage page receives that message and plays the appropriate sound. Well, it’s a fraction more complex than that. The two sounds, clapping and laughing, are constantly playing on a loop but muted. When the stage receives messages, it changes the volume on the sounds. Fortunately, the stage knows how many incoming connections there are, and it knows who the messages are coming in from, so it can scale the volume change appropriately; if most of the audience send a clap, then the stage can jack the clapping volume up to 100%, and if only a few people do then it can still play the clapping but at much lower volume. This largely does away with the need for moderation; a malicious actor who hammers the clap button as often as they can can at the very worst only make the applause track play at full volume, and most of the time they’ll be one in 50 people and so can only make it play at 5% volume or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of extra wrinkles. The first one is that autoplaying sounds are a no-no, because of all the awful advertising people who misused them to have autoplaying videos as soon as you opened a page; sound can only start playing if it’s driven by a user gesture of some kind. So the stage has an “enable sounds” checkbox; turning that checkbox on counts as the user gesture, so we can start actually playing the sounds but at zero volume, and we also take advantage of that to send a message to all the connected audience pages to tell them it’s enabled… and the audience pages don’t show the buttons until they get that message, which is handy. The second thing is that when the stage receives a clap or laugh from an audience member it rebroadcasts that to all other audience members; this means that each audience page can show a little clap emoji when that happens, so you can see how many other people are clapping as well as hear it over the conference audio. And the third… well, the third is a bit more annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an audience member closes their page, the stage ought to get told about that somehow. And it does… in Firefox. The PeerJS &lt;code&gt;connection&lt;/code&gt; object fires a &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; event when this happens, so, hooray. In Chrome, though, we never get that event. As far as I can tell it’s a known bug in PeerJS, or possibly in Chrome’s WebRTC implementation; I didn’t manage to track it down further than the PeerJS issues list. So what we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; do in the stage is poll the PeerJS connection object for every connection every few seconds with &lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt;, because it exposes the underlying WebRTC connection object, and that does indeed have a property dictating its current state. So we check that and if it’s showing &lt;code&gt;disconnected&lt;/code&gt;, we treat that the same as the &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; event. Easily enough solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more complexities than that, though. WebRTC is pretty goshdarn flaky, in my experience. If the stage runner is using a lot of their bandwidth, then the connections to the stage drop, like, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, and need to be reconnected. I suppose it would be possible to quietly gloss over this in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; and just save stuff up for when the connection comes back, but I didn’t do that, firstly because I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; it when an app pretends it’s working but actually it isn’t, and secondly because of…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the other big problem, and I don’t think it’s one that Remote Applause can fix, because it’s not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RA&lt;/span&gt;’s problem. You see, the model for this is that I’m streaming myself giving a talk as part of an online conference, right? Now, testing has demonstrated that when doing this on Twitch or YouTube Live or whatever, there’s a delay of anything from 5 to 30 seconds or so in between me saying something and the audience hearing it. Anyone who’s tried interacting with the live chat while streaming will have experienced this. Normally that’s not all that big a problem (except for interacting with the live chat) but it’s definitely a problem for this, because even if Remote Applause is instantaneous (which it pretty much is), when you press the button to applaud, the speaker is 10 seconds further into their talk. So you’ll be applauding the wrong thing. I’m not sure that’s fixable; it’s pretty much an inherent limitation of streaming video. Microsoft reputedly have a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/live-event-latency"&gt;low latency streaming video service&lt;/a&gt; but most people aren’t using it; maybe Twitch and YouTube will adopt this technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was a fun little project! Nice to have a reason to use PeerJS for something. And it’s &lt;a href="https://stuartlangridge.github.io/remote-applause/"&gt;hosted on Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; because it’s all client side, so it doesn’t cost me anything to run, which is nice and so I can just leave it up even if nobody’s using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-remote-applause-1"&gt;but it requires javascript! Aren’t you always going on about that, Stuart? Well, yes. However, it’s flat-out not possible to do real-time two-way communication sanely without it, so I’m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with requiring &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; in this particular case.

&lt;p&gt;George Hodan has created &lt;a href="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=38884"&gt;a public domain (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC0&lt;/span&gt;) map of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/map-of-england.jpg"&gt;mirror here&lt;/a&gt;), so that was a good place to start. Then a &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/makesvg.py"&gt;small Python script&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#8217;d made an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; of the&amp;nbsp;map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that&amp;#8217;s all I wanted. Hooray. The script lets me tell it how many squares I want the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; map divided up into, so I generated it in various different sizes (&lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-10x15.svg"&gt;10x15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-15x22.svg"&gt;15x22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-20x30.svg"&gt;20x30&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-30x45.svg"&gt;30x45&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-40x61.svg"&gt;40x61&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/images/uk-as-squares/uk-as-squares-50x76.svg"&gt;50x76&lt;/a&gt;) because that was convenient. If you want it in a size that isn&amp;#8217;t one of those, grab the script and go for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Online shopping at the Co-op</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/03/16/online-shopping-at-the-co-op/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-16T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-16T13:56:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-03-16:/days/2020/03/16/online-shopping-at-the-co-op/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the Saturday just gone, I thought to myself: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, better get some food in.

The cupboards aren’t bare or anything, but my freezer was showing a distinct skew towards “things that go with the main bit of dinner” and away from “things that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the main bit of dinner”, which is a long way of saying: didn’t have any meat. So, off to online shopping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sorta alternate between Tesco and Sainsbury’s for grocery shopping; Tesco decided they wouldn’t deliver to the centre of the city for a little while, but they’re back on it now. Anyway, I was rather disillusioned to see that both of them had no delivery slots available for at least a week. It seems that not only are people &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-toilet-paper-panic-buying-covid-19-uk-australia-a9403351.html"&gt;panic-buying toilet roll&lt;/a&gt;, they’re panic-buying everything else too. I don’t want to wait a week. So, have a poke around some of the others… and they’re all the same. Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Iceland… wait a week at least for a delivery. Amazon don’t do proper food in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; — “Amazon Pantry” basically sells jars of sun-dried tomatoes and things, not actual food — and so I was a little stymied. Hm. What to do? And then I thought of the &lt;a href="https://quickshop.coop.co.uk"&gt;Co-op&lt;/a&gt;. Which turned out to be an enormously pleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their online shopping thing is rather neat. There is considerably less selection than there is from the big supermarkets, it must be admitted. But the way you order shows quite a lot of thinking about user experience. You go to the &lt;a href="https://quickshop.coop.co.uk"&gt;Co-op quickshop&lt;/a&gt; and… put in your postcode. No signup required. And the delay is close to zero. It’s currently 2pm on Monday, and I fill in my postcode and it tells me that the next available slot is 4pm on Monday. Two hours from now. That’s flat-out impossible everywhere else; the big supermarkets will only have slots starting from tomorrow even in less trying times. You go through and add the things you want to buy and then fill in your card details to pay… and then a chap on a motorbike goes to the Co-op, picks up your order, and drives it to your place. I got a text message&lt;sup id="sf-online-shopping-at-the-co-op-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-online-shopping-at-the-co-op-1" class="simple-footnote" title="the company that they use to be couriers are called Stuart. This was confusing!"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when the motorbike chap set off, before he’d even got to the Co-op, giving me a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; by which I could track his progress. I got messages as he picked up the shopping and headed for mine. He arrived and gave me the stuff. All done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed very community-focused, very grass-roots. They don’t do their own deliveries; they use a courier, but a very local one. The stuff’s put into bags by your local Co-op and then delivered directly to you with very little notice. They’re open about the process and what’s going on. It seems so much more personal than the big supermarkets do… which I suppose is the Co-op’s whole shtick in the first place, and it’s commendable that they’ve managed to keep that the case even though they’ve moved online. And while the Co-op is a nationwide organisation, it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/communities"&gt;rather local and community-focused&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be shopping there again; shame on me that I had to be pushed into it this first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-online-shopping-at-the-co-op-1"&gt;the company that they use to be couriers are called Stuart.

Better buy quick &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s only 2 tickets/beds/rooms/spaces left! Now now&amp;nbsp;now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not new news. Everyone already knows this. If you ask people &amp;#8212; ordinary, real people, not techies &amp;#8212; about their experiences of buying things online or reading things online and say, &lt;em&gt;was this a pleasant thing to do? were you delighted by it?&lt;/em&gt; then you&amp;#8217;re likely to get a series of wry headshakes. It&amp;#8217;s not just that everyone knows this, everyone&amp;#8217;s rather &lt;em&gt;inured&lt;/em&gt; to it; the expectation is that it will be a bit annoying but you&amp;#8217;ll muddle through. If you said, what&amp;#8217;s it like for you when your internet connection goes down, or you want to change a flight, they will say, yeah, I&amp;#8217;ll probably have to spend half an hour on hold, and the call might drop when I get to queue position 2 and I&amp;#8217;ll have to call again, and they&amp;#8217;ll give me the runaround; the person on the call will be helpful, but Computer will Say No. Decent customer service is no longer something that we expect to receive; it&amp;#8217;s something unusual and weird. Even &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; non-hostile customer service is now so unusual that we&amp;#8217;re a bit delighted when it happens; when the corporate body politic rouses itself to do something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than cram a live rattlesnake up your bottom in pursuit of faceless endless profit then that counts as an unexpected and pleasant&amp;nbsp;surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;d be nice if the world wasn&amp;#8217;t like that. But one thing we&amp;#8217;re a bit short of is the vocabulary for &lt;em&gt;talking&lt;/em&gt; about this; rather than the online experience being a largely grey miasma of unidentified minor divots, can we enumerate the specific things that make us unhappy? And for each one, look at how it could be done better and why it should be done&amp;nbsp;better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trine Falbe, Kim Andersen, and Martin Michael Frederiksen think maybe we can, and have written &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/ethical-design-handbook-release/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ethical Design Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published by Smashing Media. It&amp;#8217;s written, as they say, for professionals &amp;#8212; for the people building these experiences, to explain how and why to do better, rather than for consumers who have to endure them. And they define &amp;#8220;ethical design&amp;#8221; as &lt;em&gt;businesses, products, and services that grow from a principle of fairness and fundamental respect towards everyone involved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They start with some justifications for why ethical design is important, and I&amp;#8217;ll come back to that later. But then there&amp;#8217;s a neat segue into different types of &lt;strong&gt;un&lt;/strong&gt;ethical design, and this is fascinating. There&amp;#8217;s nothing here that will come as a surprise to most people reading it, especially most tech professionals, but I&amp;#8217;d not seen it enumerated quite this baldly before. They describe, and name, all sorts of dark patterns and unpleasant approaches which are out there right now: mass surveillance, behavioural change, promoting addiction, manipulative design, pushing the sense of urgency through scarcity and loss aversion, persuasive design patterns; all with real examples from real places you&amp;#8217;ve heard of. Medium hiding email signup away so you&amp;#8217;ll give them details of your social media account; Huel adding things to your basket which you need to remove; Viagogo adding countdown timers to rush you into making impulsive purchases; Amazon Prime&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want my benefits&amp;#8221; button, meaning &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t subscribe&amp;#8221;. Much of this research already existed &amp;#8212; the authors did not necessarily invent these terms and their classifications &amp;#8212; but having them all listed one after the other is both a useful resource and a rather terrifying indictment of our industry and the manipulative techniques it&amp;nbsp;uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our industry does use these techniques, and it&amp;#8217;s important to ask why. The book kinda-sorta addresses this, but it shies away a little from admitting the truth: companies do this stuff because it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. Is it unethical? Yeah. Does it make people unhappy? Yeah. (They quote a &lt;a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/consumers-are-becoming-wise-to-your-nudge/"&gt;rather nice study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that half of all people recognise these tricks and distrust sites that use them, and the majority of those go further and feel disgusted and contemptuous.) But, and this is the kicker&amp;#8230; it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to hurt the bottom line. People feel disgusted or distrusting and then still buy stuff &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m sure a behavioural psychologist in the 1950s would have been baffled by this: if you do stuff that makes people not like you, they&amp;#8217;ll go elsewhere, right? Which is, it seems, not the case. Much as it&amp;#8217;s occasionally easy to imagine that companies do things because they&amp;#8217;re actually evil and want to increase the amount of suffering in the world, they do not. There are no actual demons running companies. (Probably. Hail to Hastur, just in case.) Some of it is likely superstition &amp;#8212; everyone else does this technique, so it&amp;#8217;ll probably work for us &amp;#8212; and some of it really should get more rigorous testing than it does get: when your company added an extra checkbox to the user journey saying &amp;#8220;I would not dislike to not not not sign not up for the newsletter&amp;#8221;, did purchases go up, or just newsletter signups? Did you really A/B test that? Or just assume that &amp;#8220;more signups, even deceptive ones = more money&amp;#8221; without checking? But they&amp;#8217;re not all uninformed choices. Companies do test these dark patterns, and they do work. We might wish otherwise, but that&amp;#8217;s not how the world is; you can&amp;#8217;t elect a new population who are less susceptible to these tricks or more offended by them, even if you might wish&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thereby hangs, I think, my lack of satisfaction with the core message of this book. It&amp;#8217;s not going to convince anyone who isn&amp;#8217;t already convinced. This is where we come back to the justifications mentioned earlier. &amp;#8220;[P]rivacy is important to [consumers], and it’s a growing concern&amp;#8221;, says the book, and I wholeheartedly agree with this; I&amp;#8217;ve written and delivered &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/privacy-could-be-the-next-big-thing-hackference/"&gt;a whole talk&lt;/a&gt; on precisely this topic at a bunch of conferences. But I didn&amp;#8217;t need to read this book to feel that manipulation of the audience is a bad thing: not because it costs money or goodwill, but just because it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;even if&lt;/strong&gt; it earns you more money. It&amp;#8217;s not me you&amp;#8217;ve gotta convince: it&amp;#8217;s the people who put ethics and goodwill on one side of the balance and an increased bottom line on the other side and the increased bottom line wins. The book says &amp;#8220;It’s not good times to gamble all your hard work for quick wins at the costs of manipulation&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Surveillance capitalism is unethical by nature because at its core, it takes advantage of rich data to profile people and to understand their behaviour for the sole purpose of making money&amp;#8221;, but the people doing this know this and don&amp;#8217;t care. It in fact &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good times to go for quick wins at the cost of manipulation; how else can you explain so many people &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; it? And so the underlying message here is that the need for ethical design is &lt;em&gt;asserted&lt;/em&gt; rather than demonstrated. Someone who already buys the argument (say, me) will nod their way through the book, agreeing at every turn, and finding useful examples to bolster arguments or flesh out approaches. Someone who &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; already buy the argument will see a bunch of descriptions of a bunch of things that are, by the book&amp;#8217;s definition, unethical&amp;#8230; and then simply write &amp;#8220;but it makes us more money and that&amp;#8217;s my job, so we&amp;#8217;re doing it anyway&amp;#8221; after every sentence and leave without changing&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, unfortunately, the same approach taken by other important but ignored technical influences, such as accessibility or open source or progressive enhancement. Or, outside the tech world, environmentalism or vegetarianism. You say: this thing you&amp;#8217;re doing is bad, because just look at it, it is&amp;#8230; and here&amp;#8217;s all the people you&amp;#8217;re letting down or excluding or disenfranchising by being bad people, so stop being bad people. It seems intuitively obvious to anyone who already believes: why would you build inaccessible sites and exclude everyone who isn&amp;#8217;t able to read them? Why would you build unethical apps that manipulate people and leave them unhappy and disquieted? Why would you use plastic and drive petrol cars when the world is going to burn? But it &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t work&lt;/em&gt;. I wish it did. Much as the rightness and righteousness of our arguments ought to be convincing in themselves, they are not, and we&amp;#8217;re not moving the needle by continually reiterating the reasons why someone should&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then&amp;#8230; maybe that&amp;#8217;s why the book is named &lt;em&gt;The Ethical Design Handbook&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;The Ethical Design &lt;strong&gt;Manifesto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I went into reading this hoping that what the authors had written would be a thing to change the world, a convincer that one could hand to unethical designers or ethical designers with unethical bosses and which would make them change. It isn&amp;#8217;t. They even explicitly disclaim that responsibility early on: &amp;#8220;Designers from the dark side read other books, not this one, and let us leave it at that,&amp;#8221; says the introduction. So this maybe isn&amp;#8217;t the book that changes everyone&amp;#8217;s minds; that&amp;#8217;s someone else&amp;#8217;s job. Instead, it&amp;#8217;s a blueprint for how to build the better world once you&amp;#8217;ve already been convinced to do so. If your customers keep coming back and saying that they find your approach distasteful, if you decide to prioritise delight over conversions at least a little bit, if you&amp;#8217;re prepared to be a little less rich to be a lot more decent, then you&amp;#8217;ll need a guidebook to explain what made your people unhappy and what to do about it. In that regard, &lt;em&gt;The Ethical Design Handbook&lt;/em&gt; does a pretty good job, and if that&amp;#8217;s what you need then it&amp;#8217;s worth your&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important thing: there&amp;#8217;s often the search for a silver bullet, for a thing which fixes the world. I was guilty of that here, hoping for something which would convince unethical designers to start being ethical. That&amp;#8217;s not what this book is for. It&amp;#8217;s for those who want to but don&amp;#8217;t know how. And because of that, it&amp;#8217;s full of useful advice. Take, for example, the best practices chapter: it specifically calls out some wisdom about cookie warnings. In particular, it calls out that &lt;em&gt;you don&amp;#8217;t need cookie warnings at all&lt;/em&gt; if you&amp;#8217;re not being evil about what you plan to allow your third party advertisers to do with the data. This is pretty much the first place I&amp;#8217;ve seen this written down, despite how it&amp;#8217;s the truth. And this is useful in itself; to have something to show one&amp;#8217;s boss or one&amp;#8217;s business analyst. If the word has come down from on high to add cookie warnings to the site then pushback on that from design or development is likely to be ignored&amp;#8230; but being able to present a published book backing up those words is potentially valuable. Similarly, the book goes to some effort to &lt;em&gt;quantify&lt;/em&gt; what ethical design is, by giving scores to what you do or don&amp;#8217;t do, and this too is a good structure on which to hang a new design and to use to feed into the next thing your team builds. So, don&amp;#8217;t make the initial mistake I did, of thinking that this is a manifesto; this is a &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; book, filled with how to actually get the job done, not a philosophical thinkpiece. &lt;a href="https://ethicaldesignhandbook.com/"&gt;Grab it&lt;/a&gt; and point at it in design meetings and use it to bolster your team through their next project. It&amp;#8217;s worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Android home screen widgets in HTML and JS</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/02/19/android-home-screen-widgets-in-html-and-js/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-19T19:42:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-19T19:42:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-02-19:/days/2020/02/19/android-home-screen-widgets-in-html-and-js/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like having the news headlines on my phone&amp;#8217;s home screen.

(Well, on the screen to the right.) It helps me keep up with what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world. But it&amp;#8217;s hard to find a simple headline home screen widget which isn&amp;#8217;t full of ads or extra frippery or images or tracking; I just want headlines, plain text, not unpleasantly formatted, and high-density. I don&amp;#8217;t want to see three headlines; I&amp;#8217;d rather see ten. I tried a whole bunch of news headline home screen widgets and they&amp;#8217;re all terrible; not information-dense enough, or they are but they&amp;#8217;re ugly, or they insist on putting pictures in, or they display a ton of other information I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that I don&amp;#8217;t really need a &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; reader per se; just an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader, which I then point at Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;all news&amp;#8221; feed (which they move around from time to time but at time of writing in February 2020 is at &lt;a href="https://news.google.com/news/rss"&gt;https://news.google.com/news/rss&lt;/a&gt;). However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader widgets are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; all&amp;nbsp;terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I thought: fine, I&amp;#8217;ll just do it myself. But I really don&amp;#8217;t want to write Java and set up Android Studio. So I installed &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dennis_kempf.webwidget"&gt;Web Widget&lt;/a&gt; which just renders a web page to a home screen widget, and then wrote a simple web page and stuck it at the root of my phone&amp;#8217;s storage. I can then point Web Widget at &lt;code&gt;file:///sdcard/noos.html&lt;/code&gt; and it all works, and I can customise it how I like. Every one&amp;#8217;s a winner. Nice simple way to create widgets that do what I want. They can&amp;#8217;t be animated or anything, but if you want something which displays some external data and is happy to be polled every now and again to update, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine. Sadly, there&amp;#8217;s no continuity of storage (&lt;code&gt;indexedDB&lt;/code&gt; exists but doesn&amp;#8217;t persist and &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t exist at all), but it&amp;#8217;s good for what I&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>On the Birmingham tech scene</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/02/17/on-the-birmingham-tech-scene/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-17T22:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T22:44:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-02-17:/days/2020/02/17/on-the-birmingham-tech-scene/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of kerfuffle over the last couple of days in the half of the Birmingham tech scene that I tend to inhabit, over &lt;a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/birmingham-tech-week-founder-determine-17721491"&gt;an article in Business Live&lt;/a&gt; about Birmingham Tech Week, a new organisation in the city which ran &lt;a href="https://birminghamtechweek.com/btw-events/"&gt;a pretty successful set of events&lt;/a&gt; at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of kerfuffle over the last couple of days in the half of the Birmingham tech scene that I tend to inhabit, over &lt;a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/birmingham-tech-week-founder-determine-17721491"&gt;an article in Business Live&lt;/a&gt; about Birmingham Tech Week, a new organisation in the city which ran &lt;a href="https://birminghamtechweek.com/btw-events/"&gt;a pretty successful set of events&lt;/a&gt; at the back end of last year.&lt;sup id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1" class="simple-footnote" title="That link describes the 2019 Birmingham tech week at time of writing in February 2020. I do not know whether they’ll keep the 2019 schedule around (and I hope they do and don’t just overwrite it)."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what got people’s backs up was the following from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt; organiser &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yiannismaos/"&gt;Yiannis Maos&lt;/a&gt;, quoted in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw an opportunity borne out of the frustration that Birmingham didn’t really have a tech scene, or at least not one that collaborated very much.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, it doesn’t appear that the Tech Week team did much in the way of actually trying to find out whether there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a tech scene before declaring that there probably wasn’t one. If they had then they’d have probably discovered the &lt;a href="https://calendar.birmingham.io"&gt;Birmingham.io calendar&lt;/a&gt; which contains all the stuff that’s going on, and can be &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;amp;src=movdt8poi0t3gfedfd80u1kcak@group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=Europe/London"&gt;subscribed to via Google&lt;/a&gt;. They’d probably have spoken to the existing language-specific meetups in the city before possibly doing their own instead of rather than in conjunction with. They’d have probably discovered the Brum tech Slack which has 800-odd people in it, or&lt;sup id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-2" class="simple-footnote" title="to quote Jim"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CovHack"&gt;CovHack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HackTheMidlands"&gt;HackTheMidlands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FusionMeetup"&gt;FusionMeetup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devopsdays"&gt;devopsdays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeYourFuture_"&gt;CodeYourFuture_&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yougotthisconf"&gt;yougotthisconf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/techwednesday"&gt;Tech Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/djangogirlsbrum"&gt;Django Girls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/owaspbirmingham"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWASP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opencodeclub"&gt;Open Code&lt;/a&gt; or any one of a ton of other things that are going on every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birmingham, as anyone who’s decided to be here knows, is a bit special. A person involved in tech in Birmingham is pretty likely to be able to get a similar job in London, and yet they haven’t done so. Why is that? Because Brum’s different. Things are less frantic, here, is why. We’re all in this together. London may have kings and queens: we’re the city of a &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; different trades, all on the same level, all working hand in hand. All collaborating. It’s a grass roots thing, you see. Nobody’s in charge. The calendar mentioned above is &lt;a href="https://github.com/BirminghamIO/calendar.birmingham.io/"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; exactly so that there’s not one person in charge of it and anyone else can pick it up and run with it if we disappear, so the work that’s already gone into it isn’t wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yiannis goes on to say “I guess we weren’t really banging the drum about some of the successes Birmingham had seen in regards to tech.” And this is correct. Or, more accurately, I don’t personally know whether it’s correct, but I entirely believe it. I’m personally mostly interested in the tech scene in the city being good for people in the city, not about exhibiting it to others… but that doesn’t mean that that shouldn’t be done. &lt;a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/"&gt;Silicon Canal&lt;/a&gt; already do some of that, but having more of it can’t be bad. We all want more stuff to happen, there just doesn’t need to be one thing which attempts to subsume any of the others. Birmingham Tech Week’s a great idea. I’d love to see it happen again, and it’s great that Yiannis has taken a lead on this; five thousand people showing up can’t be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to be clear, this is not an attempt to rag on them. I don’t know Yiannis myself, but I’ve been told by people whose opinions I value and who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know him that he’s not intending to be a kingmaker; that what he’s looking to do is to elevate what’s already going on, and add more to it. That’s fantastic. They’ve contacted people I know and trust to ask for opinions and thoughts. I spoke to them when they set up their own events listing and asked people to contribute to theirs specifically and I said, hey, you know there already is one of those, right? If you use that (as &lt;a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/events/"&gt;Silicon Canal do&lt;/a&gt;) and ask people to contribute to that, then we all win, because everyone uses it as the single source and we don’t have fifteen incomplete calendars. And they said, hey, we didn’t know that, soz, but we’ll certainly do that from now on, and indeed they have done so, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BirminghamTech/status/1227538112961708032"&gt;recommending to event organisers&lt;/a&gt; that they add their stuff to the existing calendar, and that’s brilliant. That’s collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of the tech scene in my city like a night out dancing. You go out for the evening to have a dance, to have a laugh. Show up on your own or with a partner or with a group, and then all get out there on the floor together and throw some shapes; be there for one minute or the whole night, nobody minds. And nobody’s directing it. Nobody &lt;em&gt;wins&lt;/em&gt; a dance. If someone tries to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; everyone how to dance and when to dance and where to dance… then it stops being fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there’s a certain amount of resistance, on my side of the fence, to kingmakers. To people who look at the scene, all working together happily, and then say: &lt;em&gt;you people need organising for your own good, because there needs to be someone in charge here. There needs to be &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise how will journalists know who to ask for opinions?&lt;/em&gt; It’s difficult to understand an organisation which doesn’t have any organisation. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates#Culture"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;W. L.&lt;/span&gt; Gore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia_(clothing)"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; are companies that work a similar way, without direct hierarchy, in a way that the management theorist Frédéric Laloux calls a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation"&gt;“teal organisation”&lt;/a&gt; and others call &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_allocation"&gt;“open allocation”&lt;/a&gt;, and they baffle people the world over too; half the managers and consultants in the world look at them and say, but that can’t work, if you don’t have bosses, nobody will do anything. But it works for them. And it seems to me to be a peculiarly Brum approach to things. If we were in this for the fame and the glory we’d have gone down to London where everyone’s terribly serious and in a rush all the time. Everyone works with everyone else; BrumPHP talks about BrumJS, Fusion talks about School of Code; one meetup directs people to others that they’ll find interesting; if the devopsdays team want a speaker about JavaScript they’ll ping BrumJS to ask about who’d be good. That’s collaboration. Everyone does their bit, and tries to elevate everyone else at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I really hope that the newspaper article was a misquote; that the journalist involved could have looked more into what’s going on in the city and then written something about all of that, too. It’s certainly easy to just report on one thing that’s going on, but exactly what makes the Birmingham tech scene different from others is that it’s rich and deep and there &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; one convenient person who knows all of it. I’d love to see Birmingham journalism talking more about the Birmingham scene. Let’s hope there’s more of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1"&gt;That link describes the 2019 Birmingham tech week at time of writing in February 2020.

Here&amp;#8217;s an insight into my decision-making&amp;nbsp;processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, repeatedly and irritatedly, complained that phones now are too big. My beloved &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z5_compact-7535.php"&gt;Sony Xperia Z5 Compact&lt;/a&gt; is the right size for a phone, in my opinion. I always, always use my phone one-handed; I never ever hold in one hand and touch the screen with the other. It is a loss to me why this, which was the normal way of using a phone for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, has been reclassified as a thing that nobody wants any more, but &lt;em&gt;c&amp;#8217;est la vie&lt;/em&gt;, I suppose. Anyway, said beloved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; finally threw a seven the other day and decided that it wouldn&amp;#8217;t do wifi any more. Or, more accurately, that it was fine doing wifi when within about two feet of the router, and not&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not ideal, I&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;#8217;s five years old. So I probably did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; out of it. And the battery life is shocking now. So I&amp;#8217;ve been vaguely thinking about getting something new for a while. I&amp;#8217;m not sure that the wifi thing is sensibly repairable, and I read &lt;a href="https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z-series/Z5-compact-poor-wifi-and-bluetooth-range-after-battery-change/td-p/1220097"&gt;a forum post&lt;/a&gt; about a chap who took his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; apart to replace the (not-user-replaceable) battery (a process which involves heating it up to break the glue behind the glass, and a bunch of other stuff that there&amp;#8217;s no way I&amp;#8217;d be able to do without breaking the phone and possibly burning down the building) and while doing so managed to snap a tiny bit of metal which then broke the wifi antenna and made it exhibit the problems I&amp;#8217;m seeing. So that&amp;#8217;s probably what happened; it got jolted or something. No chance of me fixing that; if I have to solder anything, I&amp;#8217;ll screw it up. This is the universe telling me to get a new phone, I&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, it&amp;#8217;s off to &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3?"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSM&lt;/span&gt; Arena&amp;#8217;s phone finder&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t actually have much in the way of requirements for a phone. My original list of needs&amp;nbsp;was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too big (for what exactly qualifies as not too big, read&amp;nbsp;on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too expensive (flagship phones are now a thousand pounds! even non-flagship ones are £500! I don&amp;#8217;t have a monkey just lying&amp;nbsp;around)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; (for Google Pay, which I use &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a headphone jack (because wireless headphones are pointless and expensive and worse in every conceivable way other than &amp;#8220;the cable doesn&amp;#8217;t get tangled up&amp;#8221;, and I don&amp;#8217;t like them and don&amp;#8217;t want to buy&amp;nbsp;any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made in the last couple of years, since if I&amp;#8217;m spending money on a phone I want it to last a while; there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of point replacing my 2015 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; with a phone of similar&amp;nbsp;vintage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and I like pretty things. Design is important to me. &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/12/02/i-bought-an-iphone/"&gt;Beauty, vitality, and openness&lt;/a&gt; are all&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not much of a strenuous list of requirements, to be honest. Or so I thought. I did some searches, and quickly established that I&amp;#8217;d have to get something bigger than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt;; there isn&amp;#8217;t anything at all that size, these days. So I wandered into town with the intention of picking up some actual phones to get a sense of what was too&amp;nbsp;big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was harder than it looks, because basically every phone shop now bolts all their phones to the table so they can&amp;#8217;t be picked up. All you can do is jab at the screen like a bloody caveman. This is pretty goddamn annoying when the point of the test is to see what a phone feels like in the hand. The O2 shop had a bunch of plastic &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; of phones and even those had a massive thing glued on the back with a retracting wire cable in it, as if I&amp;#8217;m going to steal a non-functional plastic box, O2, for god&amp;#8217;s sake, stop treating your customers like criminals, this is almost as bad as hotels giving you those crap two-part hangers like I&amp;#8217;m going to spend £150 on a night in the Premier Inn and then nick the hangers, what&amp;#8217;s wrong with you&amp;#8230; but it did at least let me establish that the absolute outside maximum size for a phone that I&amp;#8217;m able to tolerate is the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s10e-9537.php"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10e&lt;/a&gt;. Anything bigger than that is just too big; I can&amp;#8217;t reach the top of the screen without using my other&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search on gsmarena for &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;amp;chk35mm=selected&amp;amp;chkNFC=selected"&gt;phones less than 143mm in height, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; and 3.5mm jack, from 2018 onwards&lt;/a&gt; lists three phones. The S10e as mentioned, the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xa2-8986.php"&gt;Sony Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XA2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sharp_aquos_r2_compact-9406.php"&gt;Sharp Aquos R2 Compact&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I quite like the look of the Aquos (despite all the reviews saying &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s got two notches! not even the Nazis did that!&amp;#8221;) but as far as I can tell it just was flat never made available in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; at all; getting hold of one is hard. And the S10e, while it seems &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, is a Samsung (which I&amp;#8217;m not fond of) and more importantly is £450. This left me looking at the Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XA2&lt;/span&gt;, which was a possibility &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s sort of a grand-nephew of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt;. Reviews weren&amp;#8217;t very encouraging, but I figured&amp;#8230; this might be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Hutchings pointed out on Twitter (because &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I was bitching about this whole situation on Twitter) that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinuxJedi/status/1228647263104360449"&gt;there are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;-to-headphone-jack adaptors&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I knew this &amp;#8212; my daughter uses one to plug her headphones into her iPhone &amp;#8212; but for some reason I hadn&amp;#8217;t properly considered that option; I&amp;#8217;d just assumed that no headphone jack = stupid wireless headphones. An adaptor wouldn&amp;#8217;t be that big a deal; my headphones just get thrown in my coat pocket (I have cheapish in-ear headphones, not posh cans that go ove the ear and need a bag to carry them around in) and so I&amp;#8217;d just leave the adaptor attached to them at all times. That wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the headphone jack requirement &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;amp;chkNFC=selected"&gt;away from the search&lt;/a&gt; added two more options (and a bunch of smartwatches, unhelpfully): the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz2_compact-9082.php"&gt;Sony Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XZ2&lt;/span&gt; Compact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8_sirocco-9087.php"&gt;Nokia 8 Sirocco&lt;/a&gt;. I liked the sound of the Nokia, but&amp;#8230; not for very good reasons. My favourite ever phone from an industrial design perspective was the Nokia N9, which &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/08/03/me-and-the-nokia-n9/"&gt;I loved with a passion that was all-encompassing&lt;/a&gt;. I like the Nokia brand; it says classy and well-thought-out and well-integrated and thoughtful and elegant. And &amp;#8220;Sirocco&amp;#8221; is a cool name; I like things with names. I hate that phones are just called a code number, now. So &amp;#8220;Sirocco&amp;#8221; is much cooler than &amp;#8220;S10e&amp;#8221;. None of these are good reasons, particularly the ones that revolve around my nostalgia for the Nokia brand considering that it&amp;#8217;s been bought by some other company now. And the Sirocco only got fairly average&amp;nbsp;reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but then I &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the reviews. And all the things that reviewers didn&amp;#8217;t like, I either didn&amp;#8217;t care about or, more worryingly yet, I completely disagreed with. &amp;#8220;As the phone has a 16:9 screen rather than the now more popular 18:9 (or even 19:9) style, it already seems dated&amp;#8221; says &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/8-sirocco-review"&gt;techradar&lt;/a&gt;, for which you can just sod off. Why, why would I want a phone a foot long? That&amp;#8217;s the opposite of what I want! So reviews that complain that it&amp;#8217;s not tall enough (which was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of them) got discounted. Complaints that it&amp;#8217;s using an older chipset than some of its contemporaries don&amp;#8217;t bother me; it&amp;#8217;s quite some newer than my current phone, after all. Apparently the camera isn&amp;#8217;t perfect, about which I don&amp;#8217;t care; it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; a camera, so I&amp;#8217;m good. And they all agreed on two things: it&amp;#8217;s Android One, meaning that it&amp;#8217;s stock Android and will get updates (which I like, since my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; is stuck on Android 7 (!)), and that it&amp;#8217;s pretty. I like&amp;nbsp;pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price tag was off-putting, though. £475 on Amazon. That&amp;#8217;s rather too much; I&amp;#8217;d have to save up for that, and as noted I have a phone with no wifi, so this problem needs solving sooner rather than later. I don&amp;#8217;t mind second-hand, though, so I checked eBay and it was still £250 there, which is on the very utmost outer edge of what I can just drop on a purchase and I&amp;#8217;d have to be really convinced of it. I don&amp;#8217;t like buying things on the knock-knock, and I am in a 12-month can&amp;#8217;t-leave &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;-only contract with Three, so the idea of getting an &amp;#8220;upgrade&amp;#8221; from my carrier was a no-no even if I wanted to, which I don&amp;#8217;t (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;-only thing gives me unlimited texts and calls and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;6GB&lt;/span&gt; of data per month for nine quid. Not forty nine. Nine. I don&amp;#8217;t want to lose&amp;nbsp;that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I checked CeX. And &lt;a href="https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail/?id=snok8sir128gbunla&amp;amp;categoryName=phones-android&amp;amp;superCatName=phones&amp;amp;title=nokia-8-sirocco-128gb-black-unlocked-a"&gt;CeX had it in stock, online, class A, for £175&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? A hundred and seventy-five quid for a phone which elsewhere is nearly five&amp;nbsp;hundred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought it. And now it&amp;#8217;s not in stock online any more, so I assume I have the only one they had. This means you can&amp;#8217;t do the same. Sorry about&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s due to arrive early next week (which is the problem with buying on a Saturday). I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it goes. I&amp;#8217;m rather looking forward to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The most powerful birthday in the world</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/01/30/the-most-powerful-birthday-in-the-world/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-30T12:13:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-30T12:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-01-30:/days/2020/01/30/the-most-powerful-birthday-in-the-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKM-QWZhHTw?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

I have work I like, friends I like, my daughter, there&amp;#8217;s a pie shop within walking distance, I&amp;#8217;ve been hanging out ont he web writing these birthday posts for &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2018/01/30/and-everything/"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/30/niobium/"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/01/31/what-i-did-on-my-holidays/"&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/01/30/temporarily-older-than-benedict-cumberbatch-for-six-months-again-dammit/"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/01/30/but-these-posts-go-to-eleven/"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2013/01/30/thirty-seven-for-gods-sake-how-did-that-happen/"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/01/30/a-year-goes-past/"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2011/01/31/brave-new-age/"&gt;y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2009/01/30/mini-hippo-returns/"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2008/01/30/another-year-passes/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2007/01/30/my-week/"&gt;r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/30/turning-thirty/"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2005/01/30/staring/"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/31/birthdays/"&gt;o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2003/01/30/revolution/"&gt;w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/01/30/chicken-mcnuggets/"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number"&gt;44 is a &amp;#8220;happy&amp;#8221; number&lt;/a&gt; according to Wikipedia, and also the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s international dialling code. Internationalism is a lot on my mind, since &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51194363"&gt;Brexit happens tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, and now I have to look at government guidelines on what I have to do when &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021"&gt;&amp;#8220;travelling for business&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, which speaking at conferences in Europe apparently counts as. I am sure that this will make my life more complicated; any time you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to fill out forms, someone will screw it up, and that someone is usually me. I wish being a metropolitan elite came with the benefits that it&amp;#8217;s supposed to so I could counterbalance&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, politics aside, let&amp;#8217;s leave myself another note for next year. I&amp;#8217;m spending some of today writing proposals for work, which is good stuff. Future me, this is the &amp;#8212; how shall I describe it so that I know what it is but it remains secret? Let&amp;#8217;s call it the Vicious Cabaret project. Looks like that may happen, which is cool. I&amp;#8217;ve also made a bunch of progress during January on the top-secret Swordcello project, which shall remain under wraps, but wheels are moving. Things are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, generally. I got this fantastic envelope around a card: it&amp;#8217;s great having friends who are artists; nice one&amp;nbsp;Gaby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/andy-44-envelope.jpg" alt="aliens invade, and call me out by name. And there's a Thor stamp."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, last year I was at BrumPHP the day after my birthday; this year, I&amp;#8217;m &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/brumphp/events/266459050/"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; tonight! So pop along; might be a pint or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my creative writing energy goes 
into D&amp;amp;D, or stuff for work, or talks at conferences, or &lt;a href="https://sundayroastclub.food.blog/"&gt;#sundayroastclub&lt;/a&gt;, but I 
think quite a lot of it is bled away by Twitter; an idea 
happens, and then while it&amp;#8217;s still just an idea I tweet it and 
then it&amp;#8217;s used up. There&amp;#8217;s a certain amount of instant 
gratification involved in this, of course, but I think it&amp;#8217;s like 
a pressure valve; because a tweet is so short, so immediate, 
it&amp;#8217;s easy to release the steam in a hundred tiny bursts rather 
than one long exhalation. I&amp;#8217;m not good at metaphors, but in my 
head this seems like one of those thermometers for charities: my 
creative wellspring builds up to the overflow point &amp;#8212; call it 
the value of 50 &amp;#8212; and so I tweet something which drops it back 
down to 48. Then it builds up again to 50 and another tweet 
drops it back to 48, and so on. In the old days, it&amp;#8217;d run up to 
fifty and then keep going while I was consumed with the desire 
to write but also consumed with the time required to actually 
write something, and then there&amp;#8217;d be something long and detailed 
and interesting which would knock me back down to thirty, or 
ten, or&amp;nbsp;nought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kinda miss that. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what to do about 
it, though. Swearing off Twitter isn&amp;#8217;t really an option; even 
ignoring the catastrophic tsunami of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMO&lt;/span&gt; that would ensue, I&amp;#8217;d 
be hugely worried that if I&amp;#8217;m not part of the conversation, part 
of the zeitgeist, I&amp;#8217;d just vanish from the public discourse. Not 
sure my ego could cope with&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m between the devil and 
the deep blue sea. Neither of those are nice (which, obviously, 
is the point) but, like so many people before me, and I suspect 
me included, I think I&amp;#8217;m going to make an effort to turn more 
thoughts into writing rather than into snide asides or 
half-finished thoughts where maybe a hundred likes will finish&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I don&amp;#8217;t have comments, so your thoughts on this 
should be communicated to me via Twitter. The irony hurricane
