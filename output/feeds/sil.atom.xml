&lt;p&gt;This was not wholly unexpected, and at the same time it was completely unexpected. I should probably explain&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was ninety, which is a fair age for anyone, but her mother (my great-grandmother) lived to be even older. What&amp;#8217;s different is that nobody &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; she was ninety, other than us. Most of her friends were in their mid-seventies. Now, you might be thinking, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOL&lt;/span&gt;, old, but this is like you in your mid-forties hanging out with someone who&amp;#8217;s 30, or you in your late twenties hanging out with someone who&amp;#8217;s 13, or you at eighteen hanging out with someone who&amp;#8217;s still learning what letters are. Gaps get narrower as we get older, but the thing that most surprised me was that all her friends were themselves surprised at the age she was. &lt;em&gt;She can&amp;#8217;t have been that age,&lt;/em&gt; they said when we told them, and buried in there is a subtle compliment: &lt;em&gt;she was like us, and we&amp;#8217;re so much younger, and when we&amp;#8217;re that much older we won&amp;#8217;t be like&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. No, you won&amp;#8217;t be like my&amp;nbsp;grandma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to talk much about the last few weeks. We, my mum and me, we flew to Ireland in the middle of the night, we sorted out her house and her garden and her affairs and her funeral and her friends and her family, and we came home. All I want to say about it is that, and all I want to say about her is probably best said in the eulogy I wrote and spoke for her death, and I don&amp;#8217;t want to say it&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But (and this is where people in my family should tune out) I thought I&amp;#8217;d talk about the website I made for her. Because of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I made a website. You know how some people throw themselves into work to dull the pain when something terrible happens to the people they love? I&amp;#8217;m assuming that if you were a metalworker in 1950 and you wanted to handle your grief that a bunch of people got a bunch of metal stuff that you wouldn&amp;#8217;t ordinarily have made. Well, I am no metalworker; I build the open web, and I perform, on conference stages or for public perception. So I made a website for my grandma; something that will maybe live on beyond her and maybe say what we thought about&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I should say: it&amp;#8217;s at &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/nell"&gt;kryogenix.org/nell&lt;/a&gt; because her name was Nell and I made it. But neither of those things are really true. Her name was Ellen, and what I did was write down what we all said and what we all did to say goodbye. I wanted to capture the words we said while they were still fresh in my memory, but more while &lt;em&gt;how I felt&lt;/em&gt; was fresh in my memory. Because in time the cuts will become barely noticeable scars and I&amp;#8217;ll be able to think of her not being here without stopping myself crying, and I don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to forget. I don&amp;#8217;t want to lose it amongst memories of laughter and houses and lights. So I wrote down what we all said right now while I can still feel the hurt of it like fingernails, so maybe I won&amp;#8217;t let it fade&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write some things about the web, but that&amp;#8217;s not for this post. This post is to say: goodbye,&amp;nbsp;Grandma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Grandma. I tried to make a thing that would make people think of you when they looked at it. I wanted people to think of memories of you when they read it. So I made a thing of memories of you, and I spoke about memories of you, and maybe people who knew you will remember you and people who didn&amp;#8217;t know you will learn about you from what we all&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye,&amp;nbsp;Grandma.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General musings"></category></entry><entry><title>Talking to the Competition and Markets Authority about Apple</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2021/09/06/talking-to-the-competition-and-markets-authority-about-apple/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-06T00:05:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-09-06T00:05:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2021-09-06:/days/2021/09/06/talking-to-the-competition-and-markets-authority-about-apple/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I was part of a meeting with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority, the regulator, to talk about Apple devices and the browser choice (or lack of it) on them.

They&amp;#8217;re doing a big study into &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-apple-appstore"&gt;Apple’s conduct in relation to the distribution of apps on iOS and iPadOS devices in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, in particular, the terms and conditions governing app developers’ access to Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and part of that involves looking at browsers on iOS, and part of that involves talking to people who work on the web. So myself and &lt;a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk"&gt;Bruce Lawson&lt;/a&gt; and another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; developer of iOS and web apps put together some thoughts and had a useful long meeting with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMA&lt;/span&gt; on the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked that we keep confidential the exact details of what was discussed and asked, which I think is reasonable, but I did put together a slide deck to summarise my thoughts which I presented to them, and you can certainly see that. It&amp;#8217;s at &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/cma-apple/"&gt;kryogenix.org/code/cma-apple&lt;/a&gt; and shows everything that I presented to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMA&lt;/span&gt; along with my detailed notes on what it all&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/cma-apple/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/code/cma-apple/slides/cma-sil-12.png" alt="A slide from the presentation, showing a graph of how far behind Safari is and indicating that all other browsers on iOS are equally far behind, because they're all also Safari"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce had a similar slide deck, and you can read his slides on &lt;a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2021/briefing-to-the-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-on-apples-ios-browser-monopoly-and-progressive-web-apps"&gt;iOS&amp;#8217;s browser monopoly and progressive web apps&lt;/a&gt;. Bruce has also summarised our other colleague&amp;#8217;s presentation, which is what we led off with. The discussion that we then went into was really interesting; they asked some very sensible questions, and showed every sign of properly understanding the problem already and wanting to understand it better. This was good: honestly, I was a bit worried that we might be trying to explain the difference between a browser and a rendering engine to a bunch of retired colonel types who find technology to be baffling and perhaps a little unmanly, and this was emphatically not the case; I found the committee engaging and knowledgeable, and this is&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks we&amp;#8217;ve seen quite a few different governments and regulatory authorities begin to take a stand against tech companies generally and Apple&amp;#8217;s control over your devices more specifically. These are baby steps &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/apple-will-let-video-and-music-apps-but-not-games-link-to-other-payment-options/"&gt;video and music apps are now permitted to add a link to their own website&lt;/a&gt;, saints preserve us, after the Japan Fair Trade Commission&amp;#8217;s investigation; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;developers are now allowed to send emails to their own users which mention payments&lt;/a&gt;, which is being hailed as &amp;#8220;flexibility&amp;#8221; although it doesn&amp;#8217;t allow app devs to tell their users about other payment options in the app itself, and there are still court cases and regulatory investigations going on all around the world. Still, the tide may be changing&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like is that I can give users the best experience on the web, on the best mobile hardware. That best mobile hardware is Apple&amp;#8217;s, but at the moment if I want to choose Apple hardware I have to choose a sub-par web experience. Nobody can fix this other than Apple, and there are a bunch of approaches that they could take &amp;#8212; they could make Safari be a best-in-class experience for the web, or they could allow other people to collaborate on making the browser best-in-class, or they could stop blocking other browsers from their hardware. People have lots of opinions about which of these, or what else, could and should be done about this; I think pretty much everyone thinks that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; should be done about it, though. Even if your goal is to slow the web down and to think that it shouldn&amp;#8217;t compete with native apps, there&amp;#8217;s no real reason why &lt;a href="https://wpt.fyi/compat2021?feature=summary&amp;stable"&gt;flexbox and grid and transforms should be worse in Safari&lt;/a&gt;, right? Anyway, &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/cma-apple/"&gt;go and read the talk&lt;/a&gt; for more detail on all that. And I&amp;#8217;m interested in what you think. Do please hit me up on Twitter about this, or anything else; what do you think should be done, and&amp;nbsp;how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Last week I sat down with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Competition and Markets Authority to talk about browser choice on Apple devices, and whether the claims that limiting choice is good for security and privacy actually hold up.

&lt;p&gt;This year, in the midst of a coronavirus lockdown, it&amp;#8217;s been something of a quiet one. I got lots of nice best wishes from a bunch of people, which is terribly pleasing, and I had a nice conversation with the family over zoom. Plus, a really good Chinese takeaway delivered as a surprise from my mum and dad, and I suspect that if there were a video of them signing up for a Deliveroo account to do so it would probably be in the running for the Best Comedy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAFTA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I spent some time afternoon doing the present from my daughter, which is &lt;a href="https://theenigmagram.com/"&gt;the Enigmagram&lt;/a&gt;, an envelope of puzzles which unlock a secret message (which is how I discovered it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; from my daughter). I like this sort of thing a lot; I&amp;#8217;ve bought a couple of the &lt;a href="https://mysteriouspackage.com/"&gt;Mysterious Package Company&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s experiences as presents and they&amp;#8217;re great too. Must be a fun job to make these things; it&amp;#8217;s like an &lt;a href="https://gamedetectives.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or something, which I&amp;#8217;d also love to run at some point if I had loads of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just looked back at &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/01/30/the-most-powerful-birthday-in-the-world/"&gt;last year&amp;#8217;s birthday post&lt;/a&gt;, and I should note that Gaby has excelled herself again with birthday card envelope drawing this year, but nothing will ever, ever exceed the amazing genius that is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhVDkRwll08"&gt;the bookshelf portal&lt;/a&gt; that her and Andy got me for Christmas. It is amazing. Go and watch the video&amp;nbsp;immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for bed. I have an electric blanket now, which I was mocked for, but hey; I&amp;#8217;m allowed. It&amp;#8217;s really cosy and warm.

&lt;dl id="sil-covid-faq"&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Hang on, why did you get vaccinated? You&amp;#8217;re not 70, you&amp;#8217;re, what, thirty-six or&amp;nbsp;something?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;[bad Southern damsel accent] &amp;#8220;Why, Mr Vorce in my Haird, I do declare, I&amp;#8217;ve come over all a-flutter!&amp;#8221; [bats&amp;nbsp;eyelashes].&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Nah, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;cos I&amp;#8217;m considered clinically extremely&amp;nbsp;vulnerable.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;vulnerable?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;According to Google if you&amp;#8217;re strong and vulnerable then it&amp;#8217;s recommended to open with a no-Trump bid. That sounds like a good thing to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What&amp;#8217;s it&amp;nbsp;like?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like the flu&amp;nbsp;jab.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Like&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Fair enough. If you&amp;#8217;re reading this to learn about vaccination around the time that I&amp;#8217;m posting it, January 2021, then maybe you&amp;#8217;re someone like me who has had a bunch of injections and vaccinations, such as the flu jab every year. But if you&amp;#8217;re reading it later, you may not be, and the idea of being vaccinated against something for the first time since school might be vaguely worrying to you because it&amp;#8217;s an unknown sort of experience. This is fair. So, here&amp;#8217;s the short form of what happens: you walk into a room and roll up your sleeve, they give you an injection into your arm that you hardly even feel, you sit in the foyer for 15 minutes, and then you go home. It&amp;#8217;s like buying a kebab, except with fewer sheep&amp;nbsp;eyebrows.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a pretty short form. Some more detail than that would be&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;True. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, well, the first tip I can give you is: don&amp;#8217;t put your big heavy coat and a scarf on in the mistaken belief that it must be cold because it&amp;#8217;s January and then walk for 45 minutes to get to the hospital, because you&amp;#8217;ll be boiling hot when you get there and&amp;nbsp;aggravated.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Just the coat was the&amp;nbsp;problem?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Well, it also turns out that if you stay indoors &amp;#8220;shielding&amp;#8221; for a year and then go on a long walk, you may discover that your formerly-Olympic-level of fitness has decayed somewhat. Might have to do a sit-up or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Or two hundred and two maybe,&amp;nbsp;fatso.&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Shut up, Imaginary Voice in my&amp;nbsp;Head.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;I was told to go to the hospital for the vaccination. Other people may be told to go to their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s office instead; it seems to vary quite a lot depending on where you live and what&amp;#8217;s most accessible to you, and it&amp;#8217;s possible that I am very lucky that I was sent to &lt;a href="https://www.swbh.nhs.uk/about-us/our-hospitals/city-hospital/"&gt;City Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, somewhere within walking distance. I&amp;#8217;ve heard of others being sent to hospitals twenty miles away, which would have been a disaster for me because I don&amp;#8217;t have a car. So, either Sandwell and West Birmingham &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; Trust are particularly good, or others are particularly bad, or I happened to roll double-sixes this time, not sure&amp;nbsp;which.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;How were you&amp;nbsp;told?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;I got a phone call, yesterday, from my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;. They asked when I was available, and suggested 12.55pm today, less than twenty-four hours later; I said I was available; that was&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;And at the&amp;nbsp;hospital?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Finding the specific building was annoying. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWBH&lt;/span&gt;: put up some signs or something, will you? I mean, for goodness sake, I&amp;#8217;ve been to the hospital about twenty times and I still had no idea where it&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;No more&amp;nbsp;griping!&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t got anything else to gripe &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;. It was a marvellously smooth process, once I found the building. This is what&amp;nbsp;happened:&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;I walked up to the door at 12.45 for my appointment at 12.55. A masked woman asked for my name and appointment time; I gave them; she checked on a list and directed me inside, where I was met by a masked man. He gave me some hand sanitiser (I like hospital hand sanitiser. Seems better than the stuff I have) and directed me to a sort of booth thing, behind which was sat another&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;The booth seemed like a quite temporary thing; a rectangular box, like a ticket booth but probably made of thick cardboard, and with a transparent plastic screen dividing me from him; one of two or three of them in a line, I think. He asked me to confirm my details &amp;#8212; name, appointment time, address &amp;#8212; and then asked four or five very basic questions such as &amp;#8220;do you have the symptoms of coronavirus?&amp;#8221; Then he handed me two leaflets and directed me to two women, one of whom led me directly to an examination room in which were a man and a&amp;nbsp;woman.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;The man confirmed my details again, and asked if I&amp;#8217;d been injected with anything else in the previous month; the woman asked me to roll up my sleeve (I ended up half taking my shirt off because it&amp;#8217;s long-sleeved and rolling it all the way up to the shoulder is hard), and then gave me the injection in the upper part of my arm. Took about two seconds, and I hardly felt&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Wait, that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Yup. That whole process, from walking up to the door to being done, took maybe ten minutes&amp;nbsp;maximum.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;And then you&amp;nbsp;left?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Not quite: they ask you to sit in the waiting room for fifteen minutes before leaving, just in case you have some sort of a reaction to the injection. People who have had the flu jab will recognise that they do the same thing there, too. This gave me a chance to read the two leaflets, both of which were fairly boring but important descriptions of what the vaccine is, what vaccines are in general, and any&amp;nbsp;risks.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;They also stuck a big label on my shirt showing when my fifteen minutes was up, which I think is a really good idea &amp;#8212; they don&amp;#8217;t do this for the flu jab, in my experience, but it&amp;#8217;s a good idea for a vaccination where you have to put basically everybody through the process. I also got a little card which I&amp;#8217;m meant to show at the second vaccination, which is now safely in my wallet and will probably still be there in twenty years unless they take it off me, along with the receipts for everything I&amp;#8217;ve bought since about&amp;nbsp;2007.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;So &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;nbsp;left?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Yes. Another of the staff confirmed I&amp;#8217;d been there for long enough, asked if I was feeling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; (which I was), and asked if I had any questions. I didn&amp;#8217;t, but I did ask if I had to go back to work now or if I could just hang out there for a while longer &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m sure she&amp;#8217;d heard variations on that eighty times already that day, but she laughed anyway, and I like trying to chat to hospital staff as human beings. God alone knows what a dreadful year they&amp;#8217;ve had; they deserve courtesy and smiles from me at&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Were they&amp;nbsp;smiling?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Indeed they were. Even though you can&amp;#8217;t tell because of the masks. Everyone I spoke to and everyone there was cheery, upbeat, courteous, and competent, without being dismissive or slick. I can&amp;#8217;t speak to other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; trusts, or other hospitals, or even other days in my hospital, but every time I&amp;#8217;ve been there the staff have been helpful and nice and ready to share a joke or a chat or to answer a question, and this time was no&amp;nbsp;exception.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What, you didn&amp;#8217;t ask any questions at all? What about whether you&amp;#8217;re being microchipped by Bill Gates? And the risks of 5G with the vaccine?&amp;nbsp;And&amp;#8230;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;No, of course I didn&amp;#8217;t. Vaccination is safe, and it&amp;#8217;s one of the greatest inventions humanity has ever come up with. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; guidance on vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; is a nice summary here. If I&amp;#8217;d walked in the door and someone in scrubs had said to me, &amp;#8220;the best way to make web pages is to require &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500KB&lt;/span&gt; of JavaScript to load before you put any text on screen&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;Ubuntu has secret motives to undermine free software&amp;#8221;, I would have said to them &amp;#8220;no, you&amp;#8217;re wrong about that&amp;#8221; and argued. But me and the medical profession have an agreement: they don&amp;#8217;t tell me how to build software, and I don&amp;#8217;t tell them how to save millions of lives. This agreement is working out fine for both of us so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What&amp;#8217;s that about risks and side-effects,&amp;nbsp;though?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Apparently I may feel tired, or an ache in my arm, for the next couple of days. I&amp;#8217;ll keep an eye out. They said that if it aches a bit, taking paracetamol is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but I am not a medical professional and you should ask the question yourself when you get&amp;nbsp;vaccinated.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Which vaccine did you&amp;nbsp;have?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Remember the two leaflets? One of them is a generic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; leaflet about Covid vaccines; the other is specific to the one I had and is from BioNTech, which means it&amp;#8217;s the Pfizer one. The little wallet card also says it&amp;#8217;s Pfizer. I didn&amp;#8217;t ask the staff because I could work it out myself and I&amp;#8217;m not going to change anything based on their answer anyway; it&amp;#8217;d be pure curiosity on my part. Also, see previous point about how I don&amp;#8217;t tell them how to do their jobs. I assume that which vaccine I got was decided at some sort of higher-up area level rather than tailored for me specifically, but hey, maybe I got a specific one chosen for me. Dunno; that&amp;#8217;s for medical people to know about and for me to&amp;nbsp;follow.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;What&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;The vaccine doesn&amp;#8217;t properly kick in for a few weeks, plus you need the second injection to be properly vaccinated. That should be 9-12 weeks from now, I&amp;#8217;m told, so I&amp;#8217;ll be staying inside just as I was before. Might empty all the litter out of my wallet,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;But I have more&amp;nbsp;questions!&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sil"&gt;on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if they&amp;#8217;re sensible ones. Conspiracy stuff will just get you blocked and possibly reported with no interaction, so don&amp;#8217;t do that. But this has been a delightfully simple process, made very easy by a bunch of people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; who deserve more than having people clap a bit for them and then ignore the problems. So if I can help by answering a question or two to alleviate the load, I&amp;#8217;m happy to do that. And thank you to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;Are you really&amp;nbsp;thirty-six?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Ha! As if. It is my birthday on Saturday,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;You know that thing you said about bridge bids is nonsense,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Ah, a correction: also do not ask me questions about bridge.&amp;nbsp;Please.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openuk.uk/"&gt;OpenUK&lt;/a&gt;, who are a non-profit organisation supporting open source software, hardware, and data, and are run by Amanda Brock, have published the &lt;a href="https://openuk.uk/2021honourslist/"&gt;honours list for 2021&lt;/a&gt; of what they call &amp;#8220;100 top influencers across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s open technology communities&amp;#8221;. One of them is me, which is rather nice. One&amp;#8217;s not supposed to blow one&amp;#8217;s own trumpet at a time like this, but to borrow a line from Edmund Blackadder it&amp;#8217;s nice to let people know that you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a&amp;nbsp;trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of names on this list that I suspect anyone in a position to read this might recognise. Andrew Wafaa at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt;, Neil McGovern of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNOME&lt;/span&gt;, Ben Everard the journalist and Chris Lamb the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPL&lt;/span&gt; and Jonathan Riddell at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt;. Jeni Tennison and Jimmy Wales and Simon Wardley. There are people I&amp;#8217;ve worked with or spoken alongside or had a pint with or all of those things &amp;#8212; Mark Shuttleworth, Rob McQueen, Simon Phipps, Michael Meeks. And those I know as friends, which makes them doubly worthy: Alan Pope, Laura Czajkowski, Dave Walker, Joe Ressington, Martin Wimpress. And down near the bottom of the alphabetical list, there&amp;#8217;s me, slotted in between Terence Eden and Sir Tim Berners-Lee. I&amp;#8217;ll take that position and those neighbours, thank you very much, that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like working on open source things. It&amp;#8217;s been a strange quarter-of-a-century, and my views have changed a lot in that time, but I&amp;#8217;m typing this right now on an open source desktop and you&amp;#8217;re probably viewing it in an open source web rendering engine. Earlier this very week &lt;a href="https://popey.com/blog/2021/01/hush-keyboards-with-hushboard/"&gt;Alan Pope suggested an app idea&lt;/a&gt; to me and two days later we&amp;#8217;d made &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/"&gt;Hushboard&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a trivial app, but the process of having made it is sorta emblematic in my head &amp;#8212; I really like that we can go from idea to published Ubuntu app in a couple of days, and it&amp;#8217;s all open-source while I&amp;#8217;m doing it. I like that I got to go and have a curry with Colin Watson a little while ago, the bloke who introduced me to and inspired me with free software all those years ago, and he&amp;#8217;s still doing it and inspiring me and I&amp;#8217;m still doing it too. I crossed over some sort of Rubicon relatively recently where I&amp;#8217;ve been doing open source for more of my life than I &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; been doing it. I like that as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems with the open source community. I spoke about &lt;a href="https://linuxuserspace.fireside.fm/06"&gt;divisiveness over &amp;#8220;distros&amp;#8221; in Linux a while back&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s still not clear how to make open source software financially sustainable for developers of it. The open source development community is distinctly unwelcoming at best and actively harassing and toxic at worst to a lot of people who don&amp;#8217;t look like me, &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they don&amp;#8217;t look like me. There&amp;#8217;s way too much of a culture of opposing popularity because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; popularity and we don&amp;#8217;t know how to not be underdogs who reflexively bite at the cool kids. Startups take venture capital and make a billion dollars when the bottom 90% of their stack is open source that they didn&amp;#8217;t write, and then give none of it back. Products built with open source, especially on the web, assume (to use Bruce Lawson&amp;#8217;s excellent phrasing) that &lt;a href="https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"&gt;you&amp;#8217;re on the Wealthy Western Web&lt;/a&gt;. The list goes on and on and on and these are only the first few things on it. To the extent that I have any influence as one of the one hundred top influencers in open source in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, those are the sort of things I&amp;#8217;d like to see change. I don&amp;#8217;t know whether having a medal helps with that, but last year, 2020, was an extremely tough year for almost everyone. 2021 has started even worse: we&amp;#8217;ve still got a pandemic, the fascism has gone from ten to eleven, and none of the problems I mentioned are close to being fixed. But I&amp;#8217;m on a list with &lt;em&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/em&gt;, so I feel a little bit warmer than I did. Thank you for that, OpenUK. I&amp;#8217;ll try to share the warmth with&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;

This was more fiddly than it should be, and involved a bunch of annoying terminal work, so I’m documenting it here so I don’t lose track of how to do it should I have to do it again. It would be nice if Brother made this easier, but I suppose that it working at all under Ubuntu is an improvement on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. First, go off to the Brother website and download the scanner software. At time of writing, https://www.brother.co.uk/support/dcp7055/downloads has the software, but if that’s not there when you read this, search the Brother site for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCP&lt;/span&gt;-7055 and choose Downloads, then Linux and Linux (deb), and get the Driver Installer Tool. That’ll get you a shell script; run it. This should give you two new commands in the Terminal: &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;brscan-skey&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, teach the computer about the scanner. This is what &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4&lt;/code&gt; is for, and is all done in the Terminal. You need to know the scanner’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address; you can find this out from the scanner itself, or you can use &lt;code&gt;avahi-resolve -v -a -r&lt;/code&gt; to search your network for it. This will dump out a whole load of stuff, some of which should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;=  wlan0 IPv4 Brother DCP-7055W                             UNIX Printer         local&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;   hostname = [BRN008092CCEE10.local]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;   address = [192.168.1.21]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;   port = [515]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;   txt = ["TBCP=F" "Transparent=T" "Binary=T" "PaperCustom=T" "Duplex=F" "Copies=T" "Color=F" "usb_MDL=DCP-7055W" "usb_MFG=Brother" "priority=75" "adminurl=http://BRN008092CCEE10.local./" "product=(Brother DCP-7055W)" "ty=Brother DCP-7055W" "rp=duerqxesz5090" "pdl=application/vnd.brother-hbp" "qtotal=1" "txtvers=1"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That’s your Brother scanner. The thing you want from that is &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;, which in this case is &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.21&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4 -a name="My7055WScanner" model="DCP-7055" ip=192.168.1.21&lt;/code&gt;. This should teach the computer about the scanner. You can test this with &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4 -p&lt;/code&gt; which will ping the scanner, and &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4 -q&lt;/code&gt; which will list all the scanner types it knows about and then list your added scanner at the end under &lt;code&gt;Devices on network&lt;/code&gt;. (If your Brother scanner isn’t a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCP&lt;/span&gt;-7055W, you can find the other codenames for types it knows about with &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4 -q&lt;/code&gt; and then use one of those as the &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;brsaneconfig4 -a&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to add the scanner once, but you also need to have &lt;code&gt;brscan-skey&lt;/code&gt; running always, because that’s what listens for network scan requests from the scanner itself. The easiest way to do this is to run it as a Startup Application; open Startup Applications from your launcher by searching from it, and add a new application which runs the command &lt;code&gt;brscan-skey&lt;/code&gt;, and restart the machine so that it’s running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-setting-up-a-brother-dcp-7055w-as-a-network-scanner-on-ubuntu-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-setting-up-a-brother-dcp-7055w-as-a-network-scanner-on-ubuntu-1" class="simple-footnote" title="I hate this name. It makes us look like sniggering schoolboys. GNU Imp, maybe, or the new Glimpse fork, but the upstream developers don’t want to change it"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; installed, you’ll need to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the scanner, you should now be able to press the Scan button and choose Scan to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; and then Scan Image, and it should work. What will happen is that your machine will pop up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIMP&lt;/span&gt; with the image, which you will then need to export to a format of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite annoying if you need to scan more than one thing, though, so there’s an optional extra step, which is to change things so that it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; pop up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIMP&lt;/span&gt; and instead just saves the scanned photo which is much nicer. To do this, first install &lt;code&gt;imagemagick&lt;/code&gt;, and then edit the file &lt;code&gt;/opt/brother/scanner/brscan-skey/script/scantoimage-0.2.4-1.sh&lt;/code&gt; with sudo. Change the last line from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo gimp -n $output_file  2&amp;gt;/dev/null \;rm -f $output_file | sh &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo convert $output_file $output_file.jpg  2&amp;gt;/dev/null \;rm -f $output_file | sh &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you hit the Scan button on the scanner, it will quietly create a file named something like &lt;code&gt;brscan.Hd83Kd.ppm.jpg&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;brscan&lt;/code&gt; folder in your home folder and not show anything on screen, and this means that it’s a lot easier to scan a bunch of photos one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-setting-up-a-brother-dcp-7055w-as-a-network-scanner-on-ubuntu-1"&gt;I hate this name.

We were quite pleased with it as a concept, but: it didn&amp;#8217;t get selected for further development. Oh well, never mind. But the ideas still seem good to us, so I think it&amp;#8217;s worth publishing the proposal anyway so that someone else has the chance to be inspired by it, or decide they want it to happen.&amp;nbsp;Here:&lt;/p&gt;

I think a lot of people want their devices to live on beyond the company that sold them, and they want their devices to be under their own control, and they want to be able to do all this from any device of their choosing; their phone, their laptop, whatever. An awful lot of devices don&amp;#8217;t do some or all of that, and perhaps we can do better. That is, here&amp;#8217;s the summary of that as a sort of guiding principle, which we&amp;#8217;re going to try to&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be able to communicate &lt;strong&gt;a few hundred &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; of data&lt;/strong&gt; to the device &lt;strong&gt;locally&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;without needing a cloud service&lt;/strong&gt; by using &lt;strong&gt;a web app rather than a native app&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;an Android phone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s why that doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Android and Chrome, I am very disappointed in&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/iot-chrome-s1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reaction here is to use Bluetooth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LE&lt;/span&gt;. This is what it&amp;#8217;s for; it&amp;#8217;s easy to use, phones support it, Chrome on Android has &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web"&gt;Web Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;, everything&amp;#8217;s gravy,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, sadly. Because of the &amp;#8220;a few hundred &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; of data&amp;#8221; requirement. This is, honestly, not a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of data; a few hundred kilobytes at most. However&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s too much for poor old Bluetooth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LE&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="https://aimconsulting.com/insights/blog/wi-fi-vs-bluetooth-classic-vs-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-choosing-the-right-technology-when-designing-for-iot/"&gt;An excellent article from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt; Consulting&lt;/a&gt; goes into this in a little detail and there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="https://www.novelbits.io/bluetooth-5-speed-maximum-throughput/"&gt;much more detailed article from Novelbits&lt;/a&gt;, but transferring tens or hundreds of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; of data over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLE&lt;/span&gt; just isn&amp;#8217;t practical. Maybe you can get speeds of a few hundred kilo &lt;em&gt;bits&lt;/em&gt; per second in theory, but in practice it&amp;#8217;s nothing like that; I was getting speeds of &lt;strong&gt;twenty&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;bytes&lt;/em&gt; per second, which is utterly unhelpful. Sure, maybe it can be more efficient than that, but it&amp;#8217;s just never going to be fast enough: nobody&amp;#8217;s going to want to send a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;40KB&lt;/span&gt; image and wait three minutes for it to do so. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s good for small amounts of data; not for even medium&amp;nbsp;amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiFi to your local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/iot-chrome-s2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next idea, therefore, is to connect the device to the wifi router in your house. This is how most IoT devices work; you teach them about your wifi network and they connect to it. But&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you teach them that? Normally, you put them in some sort of &amp;#8220;setup&amp;#8221; mode and the device creates its own wifi network, and then you connect your phone to that, teach it about your wifi network, and then it stops its own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; and connects to yours instead. This is maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; if the device never moves from your house and it only has one wifi network to connect to; it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; if it&amp;#8217;s something that moves around to different places. But you still need to connect to its private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; first to do that setup, and so let&amp;#8217;s talk about&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiFi to the&amp;nbsp;device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/iot-chrome-s3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device creates its own WiFi network; it becomes a wifi router. You then connect your phone to it, and then you can talk to it. The device can even be a web server, so you can load the controlling web app from the device itself. This is ideal; exactly what I&amp;nbsp;planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it doesn&amp;#8217;t work, and as far as I can tell it&amp;#8217;s Android&amp;#8217;s fault. Bah&amp;nbsp;humbug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the device&amp;#8217;s wifi network obviously doesn&amp;#8217;t have a route to the internet. So, when you connect your phone to it, Android says &amp;#8220;hey! there&amp;#8217;s no route to the internet here! this wifi network sucks and clearly you don&amp;#8217;t want to be connected to it!&amp;#8221; and, after ten seconds or so, disconnects you. Boom. You have no chance to use the web app on the device to configure the device, because Android (10, at least) disconnects you from the device&amp;#8217;s wifi network before you can do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is the concept of a &amp;#8220;captive portal&amp;#8221;. This is the thing you get in hotels and airports and so on, where you have to fill in some details or pay some money or something to be able to use the wifi; what happens is that all web accesses get redirected to the captive portal page where you do or pay whatever&amp;#8217;s necessary and then the network suddenly becomes able to access the internet. Android will helpfully detect these networks and show you that captive portal login page so you can sign in. Can we have our device be a captive&amp;nbsp;portal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/iot-chrome-s4.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Well, we can, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, Android shows you the captive portal login page in a special cut-down &amp;#8220;browser&amp;#8221;. This captive portal browser (Apple calls it a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt;, for Captive Network Assistant, so I shall too&amp;#8230; but we&amp;#8217;re not talking about iOS here, which is an entirely different kettle of fish for a different article), this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a browser. Obviously, our IoT device can&amp;#8217;t provide a route to the internet; it&amp;#8217;s not that it has one but won&amp;#8217;t let you see it, like a hotel; it doesn&amp;#8217;t have one at all. So you can&amp;#8217;t fill anything into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt; that will make that happen. If you try to switch back to the real browser in order to access the website being served from the device, Android says &amp;#8220;aha, you closed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt; and there&amp;#8217;s still no route to the internet!&amp;#8221; and disconnects you from the device wifi. That doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t open a page in the real browser &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt;, either. You used to be able to do &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59585783/open-app-browser-android-using-captive-portal-error-social-login-with-facebook"&gt;some shenanigans with a link pointing to an &lt;code&gt;intent://&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but that doesn&amp;#8217;t work any&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we can run the whole web app &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt;? I mean, it&amp;#8217;s a web browser, right? Not an ideal user experience, but it might be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNA&lt;/span&gt; is a browser, but half of the features are turned off. There are a bunch of JavaScript APIs you don&amp;#8217;t have access to, but the key thing for our purposes is that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type="file"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements don&amp;#8217;t work; you can&amp;#8217;t open a file picker to allow someone to choose a file to upload to the device. So that&amp;#8217;s a non-starter&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what do we&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it seems that the&amp;nbsp;plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;communicate &lt;strong&gt;a few hundred &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; of data&lt;/strong&gt; to the device &lt;strong&gt;locally&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;without needing a cloud service&lt;/strong&gt; by using &lt;strong&gt;a web app rather than a native app&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;an Android&amp;nbsp;phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;isn&amp;#8217;t possible. It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be, but it isn&amp;#8217;t; there are roadblocks in the way. So building the sort of IoT device which ought to exist isn&amp;#8217;t actually possible, thanks very much Android. Thandroid. We have to compromise on one of the key&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re only communicating small amounts of data, then you can use Bluetooth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LE&lt;/span&gt; for this. Sadly, this is not something you can really choose to compromise on; if your device plan only needs small volumes, great, but if it needs more then likely you can&amp;#8217;t say &amp;#8220;we just won&amp;#8217;t send that data&amp;#8221;. So that&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;no-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use a cloud service. That is: you teach the device about the local wifi network and then it talks to your cloud servers, and so does your phone; all data is round-tripped through those cloud servers. This is stupid: if the cloud servers go away, the device is a brick. Yes, lots of companies do this, but part of the reason they do it is that they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be able to control whether you can access a device you&amp;#8217;ve bought by running the connection via their own servers, so they can charge you subscription money for it. If you&amp;#8217;re not doing that, then the servers are a constant ongoing cost and you can&amp;#8217;t ever shut them down. And it&amp;#8217;s a poor model, and aggressively consumer-hostile, to require someone to continue paying you to use a thing they purchased. Not doing that. Communication should be local; the device is in my house, I&amp;#8217;m in my house, why the hell should talking to it require going via a server on the other side of the&amp;nbsp;world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use a native app. Native apps can avoid the whole &amp;#8220;this wifi network has no internet access so I will disconnect you from it for your own good&amp;#8221; approach by calling &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62320720/android-disconnects-automatically-from-wifi-without-internet-below-android-10"&gt;various native APIs in the connectivity manager&lt;/a&gt;. A web app can&amp;#8217;t do this. So you&amp;#8217;re somewhat forced into using a native app even though you really shouldn&amp;#8217;t have&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can use something other than Android; iOS, it seems, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55138577/how-to-redirect-to-default-browser-from-captive-portal-cna-browser"&gt;has a workaround&lt;/a&gt; although it&amp;#8217;s a bit&amp;nbsp;dodgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are good answers. Currently I&amp;#8217;m looking at building native apps, which I really don&amp;#8217;t think I should have to do; this is exactly the sort of thing that the web should be good at, and is available on every platform and to everyone, and I can&amp;#8217;t use the web for it because a bunch of decisions have been taken to prevent that. There are good reasons for those decisions, certainly; I want my phone to be helpful when I&amp;#8217;m on some stupid hotel wifi with a signin. But it&amp;#8217;s also breaking a perfectly legitimate use case and forcing me to use native apps rather than the&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/iot-chrome-s5.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I&amp;#8217;m wrong? If I am&amp;#8230; this is where you tell me how to do it. Something with a pleasant user experience, that non-technical people can easily do. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t match that, I ain&amp;#8217;t doin&amp;#8217; it, just to warn you. But if you know how this can be done to meet my list of criteria, I&amp;#8217;m happy to&amp;nbsp;listen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General musings"></category></entry><entry><title>I’m not outside</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/06/04/i-m-not-outside/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-04T16:55:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-04T16:55:00+01:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-06-04:/days/2020/06/04/i-m-not-outside/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not&amp;nbsp;outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the Black Lives Matter protests going on around the world, because again a black man was murdered by police. His name was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd"&gt;George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. That was in Minneapolis; a couple of months ago &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html"&gt;Breonna Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, a black woman, was shot eight times by police in Louisville. Here in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody"&gt;black and minority ethnicity people die in police custody twice as much as others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s 31 years to the day since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests"&gt;Tiananmen Square protests&lt;/a&gt; in China in which a man stood in front of a tank, and then he disappeared. Nobody even knows his name, or what happened to&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protests in Birmingham today won&amp;#8217;t miss one individual voice, mine. And the world doesn&amp;#8217;t need the opinion of one more white guy on what should be done about all this, about the world crashing down around our ears; better that I listen and support. I can&amp;#8217;t go outside, because I&amp;#8217;m immunocompromised. The government seems to flip-flop on whether it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; for shielding people to go out or not, but in a world where there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/1268467622766620672"&gt;more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; deaths from the virus than the rest of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; put together&lt;/a&gt;, where as of today nearly forty thousand people have died in this country &amp;#8212; not been inconvenienced, not caught the flu and recovered, &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt;, a count over half that of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; civilian deaths in World War 2 except this happened in half a year &amp;#8212; in that world, I&amp;#8217;m frightened of being in a large crowd, masks and social distancing or not. But the crowd are right. The city is right. When some Birmingham council worker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AliAerosol/status/1267802971938660352"&gt;painted over an I Can&amp;#8217;t Breathe emblem&lt;/a&gt;, causing the council to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BhamCityCouncil/status/1267852703251804162"&gt;claim there was no political motive behind that&lt;/a&gt; (tip for you: I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s no council policy to do it, and they&amp;#8217;ve unreservedly apologised, but whichever worker did it sure as hell had a political motive), that emblem was back in 24 hours, and in three other places around the city too. Good one,&amp;nbsp;Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/images/blmbrum20200604.jpg" alt="Protestors in Centenary Square today"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/live-updates-black-lives-matter-18362476"&gt;apparently two thousand of you&lt;/a&gt;.

This is, I think, true. Brian&amp;#8217;s argument is that this paints a better picture of the web than a lot of the doom-saying we get about how there are only a few large companies in control of the web. This is&amp;#8230; well, I think there&amp;#8217;s truth to both sides of that. Brian&amp;#8217;s right, and what he says is often overlooked. But I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s the whole&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, diversity of rendering engines isn&amp;#8217;t actually in itself the point. What&amp;#8217;s really important is diversity of &lt;em&gt;influence&lt;/em&gt;: who has the ability to make decisions which shape the web in particular ways, and do they make those decisions for good reasons or not so good? Historically, when each company had one browser, and each browser had its own rendering engine, these three layers were good proxies for one another: if one company&amp;#8217;s browser achieved a lot of dominance, then that automatically meant dominance for that browser&amp;#8217;s rendering engine, and also for that browser&amp;#8217;s creator. Each was isolated; a separate codebase with separate developers and separate strategic priorities. Now, though, as Brian says, that&amp;#8217;s not the case. Basically every device that can see the web and isn&amp;#8217;t a desktop computer and isn&amp;#8217;t explicitly running Chrome is a WebKit browser; it&amp;#8217;s not just &amp;#8220;iOS Safari&amp;#8217;s engine&amp;#8221;. A whole bunch of long-tail browsers are essentially a rethemed Chrome and thus Blink: Brave and Edge are high up among&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, engines being open source doesn&amp;#8217;t change who can influence the &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt;; it just allows others to contribute to the implementation. Pick something uncontroversial which seems like a good idea: say, &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=avif"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVIF&lt;/span&gt; image format&lt;/a&gt; support, which at time of writing (May 2020) has no support in browsers yet. (Firefox has an in-progress implementation.) I don&amp;#8217;t think anyone particularly &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt; to this format; it&amp;#8217;s just not at the top of anyone&amp;#8217;s list yet. So, if you were mad keen on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVIF&lt;/span&gt; support being in browsers everywhere, then you&amp;#8217;re in a really good position to make that happen right now, and this is exactly the benefit of having an open ecosystem. You could build that support for Gecko, WebKit, and Blink, contribute it upstream, and (assuming you didn&amp;#8217;t do anything weird), it&amp;#8217;d get accepted. If you can&amp;#8217;t build that yourself then you ring up a firm, such as Igalia, whose raison d&amp;#8217;etre is doing exactly this sort of thing and they write it for you in exchange for payment of some kind. Hooray! We&amp;#8217;ve basically never been in this position before: currently, for the first time in the history of the web, a dedicated outsider can contribute to essentially every browser available. How good is that? Very good, is how good it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this only applies to things that everyone agrees on. If you show up with a patchset that provides support for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;stuart&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, you will be told: go away and get this standardised first. And that&amp;#8217;s absolutely&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#8217;t let you influence the strategic direction, and this is where the notions of diversity in rendering engines and diversity in influence begins to break down. If you show up to the Blink repository with a patchset that wires an adblocker directly into the rendering engine, it is, frankly, not gonna show up in Chrome. If you go to WebKit with a complete implementation of service worker support, or web payments, it&amp;#8217;s not gonna show up in iOS Safari. The companies who make the browsers maintain private forks of the open codebase, into which they add proprietary things and from which they remove open source things they don&amp;#8217;t want. It&amp;#8217;s not actually clear to me whether such changes would even be accepted into the open source codebases or whether they&amp;#8217;d be blocked by the companies who are the primary sponsors of those open source codebases, but leave that to one side. The key point here is that the open ecosystem is only actually open to non-controversial change. The ability to make, or to refuse, controversial changes is reserved to the major browser vendors alone: they can make changes and don&amp;#8217;t have to ask your permission, and you&amp;#8217;re not in the same position. And sure, that&amp;#8217;s how the world works, and there&amp;#8217;s an awful lot of ingratitude out there from people who demand that large companies dedicate billions of pounds to a project and then have limited say over what it&amp;#8217;s spent &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;, which is pretty galling from time to&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian references Jeremy Keith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://adactio.com/journal/16331"&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; in which Jeremy says: &amp;#8220;But then I think of situations where complete unity isn’t necessarily a good thing. Take political systems, for example. If you have hundreds of different political parties, that’s not ideal. But if you only have one political party, that’s very bad indeed!&amp;#8221; This is true, but again the nuance is different, because what this is about is influence. If one party wins a large majority, then it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter whether they&amp;#8217;re opposed by one other party or fifty, because they don&amp;#8217;t have to listen to the opposition. (And Jeremy makes this point.) This was the problem with Internet Explorer: it was dominant enough that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t have to give a damn what anyone else thought, and so they didn&amp;#8217;t. Now, this problem does eventually correct itself in both browsers and political systems, but it takes an awfully long time; a dominant thing has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of inertia, and explaining to a peasant in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;250AD&lt;/span&gt; that the Roman Empire will go away eventually is about as useful as explaining to a web developer in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2000AD&lt;/span&gt; that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; is coming soon, i.e., cold comfort at best and double-plus-frustrating at&amp;nbsp;worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a qualified hooray, I suppose. I concur with Brian that &amp;#8220;things are better and healthier because we continue to find better ways to work together. And when we do, everyone does better.&amp;#8221; There is a bunch of stuff that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; uncontroversial, and does make the web better, and it is wonderful that we&amp;#8217;re not limited to begging browser vendors to care about it to get it. But I think that definition excludes a bunch of &amp;#8220;things&amp;#8221; that we&amp;#8217;re not allowed, for reasons we can only speculate&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General musings"></category></entry></feed>
