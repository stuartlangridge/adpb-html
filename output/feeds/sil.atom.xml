(Well, on the screen to the right.) It helps me keep up with what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world. But it&amp;#8217;s hard to find a simple headline home screen widget which isn&amp;#8217;t full of ads or extra frippery or images or tracking; I just want headlines, plain text, not unpleasantly formatted, and high-density. I don&amp;#8217;t want to see three headlines; I&amp;#8217;d rather see ten. I tried a whole bunch of news headline home screen widgets and they&amp;#8217;re all terrible; not information-dense enough, or they are but they&amp;#8217;re ugly, or they insist on putting pictures in, or they display a ton of other information I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that I don&amp;#8217;t really need a &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; reader per se; just an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader, which I then point at Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;all news&amp;#8221; feed (which they move around from time to time but at time of writing in February 2020 is at &lt;a href="https://news.google.com/news/rss"&gt;https://news.google.com/news/rss&lt;/a&gt;). However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; reader widgets are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; all&amp;nbsp;terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I thought: fine, I&amp;#8217;ll just do it myself. But I really don&amp;#8217;t want to write Java and set up Android Studio. So I installed &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dennis_kempf.webwidget"&gt;Web Widget&lt;/a&gt; which just renders a web page to a home screen widget, and then wrote a simple web page and stuck it at the root of my phone&amp;#8217;s storage. I can then point Web Widget at &lt;code&gt;file:///sdcard/noos.html&lt;/code&gt; and it all works, and I can customise it how I like. Every one&amp;#8217;s a winner. Nice simple way to create widgets that do what I want. They can&amp;#8217;t be animated or anything, but if you want something which displays some external data and is happy to be polled every now and again to update, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine. Sadly, there&amp;#8217;s no continuity of storage (&lt;code&gt;indexedDB&lt;/code&gt; exists but doesn&amp;#8217;t persist and &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t exist at all), but it&amp;#8217;s good for what I&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>On the Birmingham tech scene</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/02/17/on-the-birmingham-tech-scene/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-17T22:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T22:44:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-02-17:/days/2020/02/17/on-the-birmingham-tech-scene/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of kerfuffle over the last couple of days in the half of the Birmingham tech scene that I tend to inhabit, over &lt;a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/birmingham-tech-week-founder-determine-17721491"&gt;an article in Business Live&lt;/a&gt; about Birmingham Tech Week, a new organisation in the city which ran &lt;a href="https://birminghamtechweek.com/btw-events/"&gt;a pretty successful set of events&lt;/a&gt; at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of kerfuffle over the last couple of days in the half of the Birmingham tech scene that I tend to inhabit, over &lt;a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/technology/birmingham-tech-week-founder-determine-17721491"&gt;an article in Business Live&lt;/a&gt; about Birmingham Tech Week, a new organisation in the city which ran &lt;a href="https://birminghamtechweek.com/btw-events/"&gt;a pretty successful set of events&lt;/a&gt; at the back end of last year.&lt;sup id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1" class="simple-footnote" title="That link describes the 2019 Birmingham tech week at time of writing in February 2020. I do not know whether they’ll keep the 2019 schedule around (and I hope they do and don’t just overwrite it)."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what got people’s backs up was the following from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt; organiser &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yiannismaos/"&gt;Yiannis Maos&lt;/a&gt;, quoted in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw an opportunity borne out of the frustration that Birmingham didn’t really have a tech scene, or at least not one that collaborated very much.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, it doesn’t appear that the Tech Week team did much in the way of actually trying to find out whether there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a tech scene before declaring that there probably wasn’t one. If they had then they’d have probably discovered the &lt;a href="https://calendar.birmingham.io"&gt;Birmingham.io calendar&lt;/a&gt; which contains all the stuff that’s going on, and can be &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;amp;ctz=Europe/London&amp;amp;src=movdt8poi0t3gfedfd80u1kcak@group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=Europe/London"&gt;subscribed to via Google&lt;/a&gt;. They’d probably have spoken to the existing language-specific meetups in the city before possibly doing their own instead of rather than in conjunction with. They’d have probably discovered the Brum tech Slack which has 800-odd people in it, or&lt;sup id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-2" class="simple-footnote" title="to quote Jim"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CovHack"&gt;CovHack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HackTheMidlands"&gt;HackTheMidlands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FusionMeetup"&gt;FusionMeetup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devopsdays"&gt;devopsdays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeYourFuture_"&gt;CodeYourFuture_&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yougotthisconf"&gt;yougotthisconf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/techwednesday"&gt;Tech Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/djangogirlsbrum"&gt;Django Girls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/owaspbirmingham"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWASP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opencodeclub"&gt;Open Code&lt;/a&gt; or any one of a ton of other things that are going on every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birmingham, as anyone who’s decided to be here knows, is a bit special. A person involved in tech in Birmingham is pretty likely to be able to get a similar job in London, and yet they haven’t done so. Why is that? Because Brum’s different. Things are less frantic, here, is why. We’re all in this together. London may have kings and queens: we’re the city of a &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; different trades, all on the same level, all working hand in hand. All collaborating. It’s a grass roots thing, you see. Nobody’s in charge. The calendar mentioned above is &lt;a href="https://github.com/BirminghamIO/calendar.birmingham.io/"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; exactly so that there’s not one person in charge of it and anyone else can pick it up and run with it if we disappear, so the work that’s already gone into it isn’t wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yiannis goes on to say “I guess we weren’t really banging the drum about some of the successes Birmingham had seen in regards to tech.” And this is correct. Or, more accurately, I don’t personally know whether it’s correct, but I entirely believe it. I’m personally mostly interested in the tech scene in the city being good for people in the city, not about exhibiting it to others… but that doesn’t mean that that shouldn’t be done. &lt;a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/"&gt;Silicon Canal&lt;/a&gt; already do some of that, but having more of it can’t be bad. We all want more stuff to happen, there just doesn’t need to be one thing which attempts to subsume any of the others. Birmingham Tech Week’s a great idea. I’d love to see it happen again, and it’s great that Yiannis has taken a lead on this; five thousand people showing up can’t be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to be clear, this is not an attempt to rag on them. I don’t know Yiannis myself, but I’ve been told by people whose opinions I value and who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know him that he’s not intending to be a kingmaker; that what he’s looking to do is to elevate what’s already going on, and add more to it. That’s fantastic. They’ve contacted people I know and trust to ask for opinions and thoughts. I spoke to them when they set up their own events listing and asked people to contribute to theirs specifically and I said, hey, you know there already is one of those, right? If you use that (as &lt;a href="https://siliconcanal.co.uk/events/"&gt;Silicon Canal do&lt;/a&gt;) and ask people to contribute to that, then we all win, because everyone uses it as the single source and we don’t have fifteen incomplete calendars. And they said, hey, we didn’t know that, soz, but we’ll certainly do that from now on, and indeed they have done so, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BirminghamTech/status/1227538112961708032"&gt;recommending to event organisers&lt;/a&gt; that they add their stuff to the existing calendar, and that’s brilliant. That’s collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of the tech scene in my city like a night out dancing. You go out for the evening to have a dance, to have a laugh. Show up on your own or with a partner or with a group, and then all get out there on the floor together and throw some shapes; be there for one minute or the whole night, nobody minds. And nobody’s directing it. Nobody &lt;em&gt;wins&lt;/em&gt; a dance. If someone tries to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; everyone how to dance and when to dance and where to dance… then it stops being fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there’s a certain amount of resistance, on my side of the fence, to kingmakers. To people who look at the scene, all working together happily, and then say: &lt;em&gt;you people need organising for your own good, because there needs to be someone in charge here. There needs to be &lt;strong&gt;hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise how will journalists know who to ask for opinions?&lt;/em&gt; It’s difficult to understand an organisation which doesn’t have any organisation. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates#Culture"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;W. L.&lt;/span&gt; Gore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia_(clothing)"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; are companies that work a similar way, without direct hierarchy, in a way that the management theorist Frédéric Laloux calls a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation"&gt;“teal organisation”&lt;/a&gt; and others call &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_allocation"&gt;“open allocation”&lt;/a&gt;, and they baffle people the world over too; half the managers and consultants in the world look at them and say, but that can’t work, if you don’t have bosses, nobody will do anything. But it works for them. And it seems to me to be a peculiarly Brum approach to things. If we were in this for the fame and the glory we’d have gone down to London where everyone’s terribly serious and in a rush all the time. Everyone works with everyone else; BrumPHP talks about BrumJS, Fusion talks about School of Code; one meetup directs people to others that they’ll find interesting; if the devopsdays team want a speaker about JavaScript they’ll ping BrumJS to ask about who’d be good. That’s collaboration. Everyone does their bit, and tries to elevate everyone else at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I really hope that the newspaper article was a misquote; that the journalist involved could have looked more into what’s going on in the city and then written something about all of that, too. It’s certainly easy to just report on one thing that’s going on, but exactly what makes the Birmingham tech scene different from others is that it’s rich and deep and there &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; one convenient person who knows all of it. I’d love to see Birmingham journalism talking more about the Birmingham scene. Let’s hope there’s more of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-on-the-birmingham-tech-scene-1"&gt;That link describes the 2019 Birmingham tech week at time of writing in February 2020.

Here&amp;#8217;s an insight into my decision-making&amp;nbsp;processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, repeatedly and irritatedly, complained that phones now are too big. My beloved &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z5_compact-7535.php"&gt;Sony Xperia Z5 Compact&lt;/a&gt; is the right size for a phone, in my opinion. I always, always use my phone one-handed; I never ever hold in one hand and touch the screen with the other. It is a loss to me why this, which was the normal way of using a phone for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, has been reclassified as a thing that nobody wants any more, but &lt;em&gt;c&amp;#8217;est la vie&lt;/em&gt;, I suppose. Anyway, said beloved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; finally threw a seven the other day and decided that it wouldn&amp;#8217;t do wifi any more. Or, more accurately, that it was fine doing wifi when within about two feet of the router, and not&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not ideal, I&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;#8217;s five years old. So I probably did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; out of it. And the battery life is shocking now. So I&amp;#8217;ve been vaguely thinking about getting something new for a while. I&amp;#8217;m not sure that the wifi thing is sensibly repairable, and I read &lt;a href="https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z-series/Z5-compact-poor-wifi-and-bluetooth-range-after-battery-change/td-p/1220097"&gt;a forum post&lt;/a&gt; about a chap who took his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; apart to replace the (not-user-replaceable) battery (a process which involves heating it up to break the glue behind the glass, and a bunch of other stuff that there&amp;#8217;s no way I&amp;#8217;d be able to do without breaking the phone and possibly burning down the building) and while doing so managed to snap a tiny bit of metal which then broke the wifi antenna and made it exhibit the problems I&amp;#8217;m seeing. So that&amp;#8217;s probably what happened; it got jolted or something. No chance of me fixing that; if I have to solder anything, I&amp;#8217;ll screw it up. This is the universe telling me to get a new phone, I&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, it&amp;#8217;s off to &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/search.php3?"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSM&lt;/span&gt; Arena&amp;#8217;s phone finder&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t actually have much in the way of requirements for a phone. My original list of needs&amp;nbsp;was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too big (for what exactly qualifies as not too big, read&amp;nbsp;on)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too expensive (flagship phones are now a thousand pounds! even non-flagship ones are £500! I don&amp;#8217;t have a monkey just lying&amp;nbsp;around)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; (for Google Pay, which I use &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a headphone jack (because wireless headphones are pointless and expensive and worse in every conceivable way other than &amp;#8220;the cable doesn&amp;#8217;t get tangled up&amp;#8221;, and I don&amp;#8217;t like them and don&amp;#8217;t want to buy&amp;nbsp;any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made in the last couple of years, since if I&amp;#8217;m spending money on a phone I want it to last a while; there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of point replacing my 2015 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; with a phone of similar&amp;nbsp;vintage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and I like pretty things. Design is important to me. &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/12/02/i-bought-an-iphone/"&gt;Beauty, vitality, and openness&lt;/a&gt; are all&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not much of a strenuous list of requirements, to be honest. Or so I thought. I did some searches, and quickly established that I&amp;#8217;d have to get something bigger than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt;; there isn&amp;#8217;t anything at all that size, these days. So I wandered into town with the intention of picking up some actual phones to get a sense of what was too&amp;nbsp;big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was harder than it looks, because basically every phone shop now bolts all their phones to the table so they can&amp;#8217;t be picked up. All you can do is jab at the screen like a bloody caveman. This is pretty goddamn annoying when the point of the test is to see what a phone feels like in the hand. The O2 shop had a bunch of plastic &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; of phones and even those had a massive thing glued on the back with a retracting wire cable in it, as if I&amp;#8217;m going to steal a non-functional plastic box, O2, for god&amp;#8217;s sake, stop treating your customers like criminals, this is almost as bad as hotels giving you those crap two-part hangers like I&amp;#8217;m going to spend £150 on a night in the Premier Inn and then nick the hangers, what&amp;#8217;s wrong with you&amp;#8230; but it did at least let me establish that the absolute outside maximum size for a phone that I&amp;#8217;m able to tolerate is the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s10e-9537.php"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10e&lt;/a&gt;. Anything bigger than that is just too big; I can&amp;#8217;t reach the top of the screen without using my other&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search on gsmarena for &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;amp;chk35mm=selected&amp;amp;chkNFC=selected"&gt;phones less than 143mm in height, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; and 3.5mm jack, from 2018 onwards&lt;/a&gt; lists three phones. The S10e as mentioned, the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xa2-8986.php"&gt;Sony Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XA2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sharp_aquos_r2_compact-9406.php"&gt;Sharp Aquos R2 Compact&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I quite like the look of the Aquos (despite all the reviews saying &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s got two notches! not even the Nazis did that!&amp;#8221;) but as far as I can tell it just was flat never made available in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; at all; getting hold of one is hard. And the S10e, while it seems &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, is a Samsung (which I&amp;#8217;m not fond of) and more importantly is £450. This left me looking at the Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XA2&lt;/span&gt;, which was a possibility &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s sort of a grand-nephew of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt;. Reviews weren&amp;#8217;t very encouraging, but I figured&amp;#8230; this might be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Hutchings pointed out on Twitter (because &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I was bitching about this whole situation on Twitter) that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinuxJedi/status/1228647263104360449"&gt;there are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;-to-headphone-jack adaptors&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I knew this &amp;#8212; my daughter uses one to plug her headphones into her iPhone &amp;#8212; but for some reason I hadn&amp;#8217;t properly considered that option; I&amp;#8217;d just assumed that no headphone jack = stupid wireless headphones. An adaptor wouldn&amp;#8217;t be that big a deal; my headphones just get thrown in my coat pocket (I have cheapish in-ear headphones, not posh cans that go ove the ear and need a bag to carry them around in) and so I&amp;#8217;d just leave the adaptor attached to them at all times. That wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the headphone jack requirement &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&amp;amp;nHeightMax=143&amp;amp;chkNFC=selected"&gt;away from the search&lt;/a&gt; added two more options (and a bunch of smartwatches, unhelpfully): the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz2_compact-9082.php"&gt;Sony Xperia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XZ2&lt;/span&gt; Compact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_8_sirocco-9087.php"&gt;Nokia 8 Sirocco&lt;/a&gt;. I liked the sound of the Nokia, but&amp;#8230; not for very good reasons. My favourite ever phone from an industrial design perspective was the Nokia N9, which &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/08/03/me-and-the-nokia-n9/"&gt;I loved with a passion that was all-encompassing&lt;/a&gt;. I like the Nokia brand; it says classy and well-thought-out and well-integrated and thoughtful and elegant. And &amp;#8220;Sirocco&amp;#8221; is a cool name; I like things with names. I hate that phones are just called a code number, now. So &amp;#8220;Sirocco&amp;#8221; is much cooler than &amp;#8220;S10e&amp;#8221;. None of these are good reasons, particularly the ones that revolve around my nostalgia for the Nokia brand considering that it&amp;#8217;s been bought by some other company now. And the Sirocco only got fairly average&amp;nbsp;reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but then I &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the reviews. And all the things that reviewers didn&amp;#8217;t like, I either didn&amp;#8217;t care about or, more worryingly yet, I completely disagreed with. &amp;#8220;As the phone has a 16:9 screen rather than the now more popular 18:9 (or even 19:9) style, it already seems dated&amp;#8221; says &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/8-sirocco-review"&gt;techradar&lt;/a&gt;, for which you can just sod off. Why, why would I want a phone a foot long? That&amp;#8217;s the opposite of what I want! So reviews that complain that it&amp;#8217;s not tall enough (which was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of them) got discounted. Complaints that it&amp;#8217;s using an older chipset than some of its contemporaries don&amp;#8217;t bother me; it&amp;#8217;s quite some newer than my current phone, after all. Apparently the camera isn&amp;#8217;t perfect, about which I don&amp;#8217;t care; it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; a camera, so I&amp;#8217;m good. And they all agreed on two things: it&amp;#8217;s Android One, meaning that it&amp;#8217;s stock Android and will get updates (which I like, since my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Z5C&lt;/span&gt; is stuck on Android 7 (!)), and that it&amp;#8217;s pretty. I like&amp;nbsp;pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price tag was off-putting, though. £475 on Amazon. That&amp;#8217;s rather too much; I&amp;#8217;d have to save up for that, and as noted I have a phone with no wifi, so this problem needs solving sooner rather than later. I don&amp;#8217;t mind second-hand, though, so I checked eBay and it was still £250 there, which is on the very utmost outer edge of what I can just drop on a purchase and I&amp;#8217;d have to be really convinced of it. I don&amp;#8217;t like buying things on the knock-knock, and I am in a 12-month can&amp;#8217;t-leave &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;-only contract with Three, so the idea of getting an &amp;#8220;upgrade&amp;#8221; from my carrier was a no-no even if I wanted to, which I don&amp;#8217;t (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;-only thing gives me unlimited texts and calls and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;6GB&lt;/span&gt; of data per month for nine quid. Not forty nine. Nine. I don&amp;#8217;t want to lose&amp;nbsp;that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I checked CeX. And &lt;a href="https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail/?id=snok8sir128gbunla&amp;amp;categoryName=phones-android&amp;amp;superCatName=phones&amp;amp;title=nokia-8-sirocco-128gb-black-unlocked-a"&gt;CeX had it in stock, online, class A, for £175&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? A hundred and seventy-five quid for a phone which elsewhere is nearly five&amp;nbsp;hundred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought it. And now it&amp;#8217;s not in stock online any more, so I assume I have the only one they had. This means you can&amp;#8217;t do the same. Sorry about&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s due to arrive early next week (which is the problem with buying on a Saturday). I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how it goes. I&amp;#8217;m rather looking forward to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The most powerful birthday in the world</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/01/30/the-most-powerful-birthday-in-the-world/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-30T12:13:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-30T12:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-01-30:/days/2020/01/30/the-most-powerful-birthday-in-the-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKM-QWZhHTw?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Internationalism is a lot on my mind, since &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51194363"&gt;Brexit happens tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;, and now I have to look at government guidelines on what I have to do when &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021"&gt;&amp;#8220;travelling for business&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, which speaking at conferences in Europe apparently counts as. I am sure that this will make my life more complicated; any time you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to fill out forms, someone will screw it up, and that someone is usually me. I wish being a metropolitan elite came with the benefits that it&amp;#8217;s supposed to so I could counterbalance&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, politics aside, let&amp;#8217;s leave myself another note for next year. I&amp;#8217;m spending some of today writing proposals for work, which is good stuff. Future me, this is the &amp;#8212; how shall I describe it so that I know what it is but it remains secret? Let&amp;#8217;s call it the Vicious Cabaret project. Looks like that may happen, which is cool. I&amp;#8217;ve also made a bunch of progress during January on the top-secret Swordcello project, which shall remain under wraps, but wheels are moving. Things are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, generally. I got this fantastic envelope around a card: it&amp;#8217;s great having friends who are artists; nice one&amp;nbsp;Gaby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/andy-44-envelope.jpg" alt="aliens invade, and call me out by name. And there's a Thor stamp."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, last year I was at BrumPHP the day after my birthday; this year, I&amp;#8217;m &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/brumphp/events/266459050/"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; tonight! So pop along; might be a pint or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my creative writing energy goes 
into D&amp;amp;D, or stuff for work, or talks at conferences, or &lt;a href="https://sundayroastclub.food.blog/"&gt;#sundayroastclub&lt;/a&gt;, but I 
think quite a lot of it is bled away by Twitter; an idea 
happens, and then while it&amp;#8217;s still just an idea I tweet it and 
then it&amp;#8217;s used up. There&amp;#8217;s a certain amount of instant 
gratification involved in this, of course, but I think it&amp;#8217;s like 
a pressure valve; because a tweet is so short, so immediate, 
it&amp;#8217;s easy to release the steam in a hundred tiny bursts rather 
than one long exhalation. I&amp;#8217;m not good at metaphors, but in my 
head this seems like one of those thermometers for charities: my 
creative wellspring builds up to the overflow point &amp;#8212; call it 
the value of 50 &amp;#8212; and so I tweet something which drops it back 
down to 48. Then it builds up again to 50 and another tweet 
drops it back to 48, and so on. In the old days, it&amp;#8217;d run up to 
fifty and then keep going while I was consumed with the desire 
to write but also consumed with the time required to actually 
write something, and then there&amp;#8217;d be something long and detailed 
and interesting which would knock me back down to thirty, or 
ten, or&amp;nbsp;nought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kinda miss that. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what to do about 
it, though. Swearing off Twitter isn&amp;#8217;t really an option; even 
ignoring the catastrophic tsunami of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMO&lt;/span&gt; that would ensue, I&amp;#8217;d 
be hugely worried that if I&amp;#8217;m not part of the conversation, part 
of the zeitgeist, I&amp;#8217;d just vanish from the public discourse. Not 
sure my ego could cope with&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m between the devil and 
the deep blue sea. Neither of those are nice (which, obviously, 
is the point) but, like so many people before me, and I suspect 
me included, I think I&amp;#8217;m going to make an effort to turn more 
thoughts into writing rather than into snide asides or 
half-finished thoughts where maybe a hundred likes will finish&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I don&amp;#8217;t have comments, so your thoughts on this 
should be communicated to me via Twitter. The irony hurricane 
proceeds apace. (Or on your own weblog which then sends me a 
webmention via the form below, of course, but that&amp;#8217;s not all 
that likely yet.) Check in a month whether I&amp;#8217;ve even remotely 
stuck to this or if I&amp;#8217;ve just taken the easy&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Number word sequences</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/01/19/number-word-sequences/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-19T22:02:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-19T22:02:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-01-19:/days/2020/01/19/number-word-sequences/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was idly musing about number sequences, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number"&gt;Lychrel algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.

If you don’t know about this, there’s a good &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN8PE3eljdA"&gt;Numberphile video&lt;/a&gt; on it: basically, take any number, reverse it, add the two, and if you get a palindrome stop, and if you don’t, keep doing it. So start with, say, &lt;code&gt;57&lt;/code&gt;, reverse to get &lt;code&gt;75&lt;/code&gt;, add them to get &lt;code&gt;57+75=132&lt;/code&gt;, which isn’t a palindrome, so do it again; reverse &lt;code&gt;132&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;231&lt;/code&gt;, add to get &lt;code&gt;132+231=363&lt;/code&gt;, and that’s a palindrome, so stop. There are a bunch of interesting questions that can be asked about this process (which James Grime goes into in the video), among which are: does this always terminate? What’s the longest chain before termination? And so on. &lt;code&gt;196&lt;/code&gt; famously hasn’t terminated so far and it’s been tried for several billion iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was thinking about another such iterative process. Take a number, express it in words, then add up the values of all the letters in the words, and do it again. So &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;ONE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ONE&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;15, 14, 5&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; is the fifteenth letter of the alphabet, &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; the fourteenth, and so on), so we add &lt;code&gt;15+14+5&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;34&lt;/code&gt;, which becomes &lt;code&gt;THIRTY FOUR&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. (We skip spaces and dashes; just the letters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a complete example: let’s start with 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;FOUR&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;6+15+21+18 = 60&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;60&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;SIXTY&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;19+9+24+20+25 = 97&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;97&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;NINETY-SEVEN&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;14+9+14+5+20+25+19+5+22+5+14 = 152&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;152&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-TWO&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;15+14+5+8+21+14+4+18+5+4+1+14+4+6+9+6+20+25+20+23+15 = 251&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;251&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-ONE&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;20+23+15+8+21+14+4+18+5+4+1+14+4+6+9+6+20+25+15+14+5 = 251&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;251&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;fixed point&lt;/em&gt;: it becomes itself. So we stop there, because we’re now in an infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/numwords_4_en.png" alt="A graph of this iterative process, starting at 4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do all numbers eventually go into a loop? Do all numbers go into the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; loop — that is, do they all end up at &lt;code&gt;251&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to tell. (Well, it’s hard to tell for me. Some of you may see some easy way to prove this, in which case do let me know.) Me being me, I wrote a little Python programme to test this out (helped immeasurably by the Python 3 &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/num2words/"&gt;num2words&lt;/a&gt; library). As I discovered before, if you’re trying to pick out patterns in a big graph of numbers which all link to one another, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2018/03/25/squares-and-prettier-graphs/"&gt;a lot easier to have graphviz draw you pretty pictures&lt;/a&gt;, so that’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve run numbers up to 5000 or so (after that I got a bit bored waiting for answers; it’s not recreational mathematics if I have to wait around, it’s a job for which I’m not getting paid). And it looks like numbers settle out into a tiny island which ends up at &lt;code&gt;251&lt;/code&gt;, a little island which ends up at &lt;code&gt;285&lt;/code&gt;, and a massive island which ends up at &lt;code&gt;259&lt;/code&gt;, all of which become themselves&lt;sup id="sf-number-word-sequences-1-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-number-word-sequences-1" class="simple-footnote" title="Well, 285 is part of a 285, 267, 313, 248, 284, 285 loop."&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. (You can see &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/numwords_en.png"&gt;an image of the first 500 numbers&lt;/a&gt; and how they end up; extending that up to 5000 just makes the islands larger, it doesn’t create new islands… and the diagrams either get rather unwieldy or they get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; big and they’re hard to display.&lt;sup id="sf-number-word-sequences-2-back"&gt;&lt;a href="#sf-number-word-sequences-2" class="simple-footnote" title="This is also why the graphs use neato, which is much less pleasing a layout for this than the “tree”-style layout of dot, because the dot images end up being 32,767 pixels across and all is a disaster."&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/numwords_en.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/numwords_small_en.png" alt="A graph of the first 500 numbers and their connections"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a theory that (a) yes all numbers end up in a fixed point and (b) there probably aren’t any more fixed points. Warning: dubious mathematical assertions lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can’t be that many numbers that encode to themselves. This is both because I’ve run it up to 5000 and there aren’t, and because it just seems kinda unlikely and coincidental. So, we assume that the fixed points we have are most or all of the fixed points available. Now, every number has to end up &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;; the process can’t just keep going forever. So, if you keep generating numbers, you’re pretty likely at some point to hit a number you’ve already hit, which ends up at one of the fixed points. And finally, the numbers-to-words process doesn’t grow as fast as actual numbers do. Once you’ve got over a certain limit, you’ll pretty much always end up generating a number smaller than oneself in the next iteration. The reason I think this is that adding more to numbers doesn’t make their word lengths all that much longer. Take, for example, the longest number (in words) up to 100,000, which is (among others) &lt;code&gt;73,373&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;seventy-three thousand, three hundred and seventy-three&lt;/code&gt;. This is &lt;code&gt;47&lt;/code&gt; characters long. Even if they were all &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt;, which they aren’t, it’d generate &lt;code&gt;47×26=1222&lt;/code&gt;, which is way less than &lt;code&gt;73,373&lt;/code&gt;. And adding lots more doesn’t help much: if we add a million to that number, we put &lt;code&gt;one million&lt;/code&gt; on the front of it, which is only another &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; characters, or a maximum added value of &lt;code&gt;260&lt;/code&gt;. There’s no actual ceiling — numbers in words still grow without limit as the number itself grows — but it doesn’t grow anywhere near as fast as the number itself does. So the numbers generally get smaller as they iterate, until they get down below four hundred or so… and all of those numbers terminate in one of the three fixed points already outlined. So I think that all numbers will terminate thus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious flaw with this argument is that it ought to apply to the reverse-and-add process above too and it doesn’t for 196 (and some others). So it’s possible that my approach will also make a Lychrel-ish number that may not terminate, but I don’t think it will; the argument above seems compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking: bloody English imperialist! What about &lt;em&gt;les nombres&lt;/em&gt;, eh? Or &lt;em&gt;die Zahlen&lt;/em&gt;? Did you check those? &lt;em&gt;Mais oui&lt;/em&gt;, I checked (nice one &lt;code&gt;num2words&lt;/code&gt; for supporting a zillion languages!) Same thing. There are different fixed points (&lt;del&gt;French has one big island until &lt;code&gt;177&lt;/code&gt;, a very small island to &lt;code&gt;232&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;258, 436&lt;/code&gt; pair, and &lt;code&gt;222&lt;/code&gt; which encodes to itself and nothing else encodes to it, for example.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Not quite: see the update at the end. Nothing changes about the maths, though.&lt;/ins&gt; Images of &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/numwords_fr.png"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/numwords_de.png"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; are available, and you can of course use &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/numwords.py"&gt;the Python 3 script&lt;/a&gt; to make your own; run it as &lt;code&gt;python3 numwords.py no&lt;/code&gt; for Norwegian, etc.) You may also be thinking “what about American English, eh? &lt;code&gt;101&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;ONE HUNDRED ONE&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;ONE HUNDRED AND ONE&lt;/code&gt;.” I have not tested this, partially because I think the above argument should still hold for it, partially because &lt;code&gt;num2words&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t support it, and partially because that’s what you get for throwing a bunch of perfectly good tea into the ocean, but I don’t think it’d be hard to verify if someone wants to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No earth-shattering revelations here, not that it matters anyway because I’m 43 and you can only win a Fields Medal if you’re under forty, but this was a fun little diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Minirop &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/minirop/status/1219191671746940928"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that my code wasn’t correctly highlighting the “end” of a chain, which indeed it was not. I’ve poked the code, and the diagrams, to do this better; it’s apparent that both &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/numwords_fr.png"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/images/numwords_de.png"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; have most numbers end up in a fairy large loop, rather than at one specific number. I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this alters my argument for why this is likely to happen for all numbers (because a loop of numbers which all encode to one another is about as rare as a single number which encodes to itself, I’d guess), but maybe I haven’t thought about it enough!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-number-word-sequences-1"&gt;Well, 285 is part of a 285, 267, 313, 248, 284, 285 loop. &lt;a href="#sf-number-word-sequences-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-number-word-sequences-2"&gt;This is also why the graphs use &lt;code&gt;neato&lt;/code&gt;, which is much less pleasing a layout for this than the “tree”-style layout of &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; images end up being 32,767 pixels across and all is a disaster. &lt;a href="#sf-number-word-sequences-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The tiniest of Python templating engines</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2020/01/19/the-tiniest-of-python-templating-engines/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-19T10:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-19T10:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2020-01-19:/days/2020/01/19/the-tiniest-of-python-templating-engines/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In someone else&amp;#8217;s project (which they&amp;#8217;ll doubtless tell you about themselves when it&amp;#8217;s done) I needed a tiny Python templating engine.

That is: I wanted to be able to say, here is a template string, please substitute a bunch of variables into it. Now, Python already does this, in about &lt;a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating"&gt;thirty different ways&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting"&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings"&gt;&lt;code&gt;string.Template&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; do most of it as&amp;nbsp;built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt; works like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;My name is {name} and I am {age} years old&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Stuart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;string.Template&lt;/code&gt; like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;My name is $name and I am $age years old&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;safe_substitute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Stuart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both of which are pretty &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what they&amp;#8217;re missing is loops; having more than one of a thing in your template, and looping over a list, substituting it each time. Every even fractionally-more-featureful templating system has this, whether &lt;a href="http://mustache.github.io/"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/"&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; or whatever, of course, but I didn&amp;#8217;t want another dependency. All I needed was &lt;code&gt;str.format&lt;/code&gt; but with loops. So, I thought, I&amp;#8217;ll write one, in about four lines of code, so I can just drop the function in to my Python file and then I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;loophandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;groupdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;var&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;\{loop (?P&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;[^}]+)\}(?P&amp;lt;content&amp;gt;.*?)\{endloop\}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="n"&gt;loophandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DOTALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And lo, twas so. So I can now&amp;nbsp;do &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I am {name} and my imps&amp;#39; names are: {loop imps}{name}{endloop}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Stuart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;imps&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Pyweazle&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Grimthacket&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hardebon&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and it all works. Not revolutionary, of course, but I was mildly pleased with&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much internal debate about whether &lt;code&gt;loophandler()&lt;/code&gt; should have been a &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;, but I eventually decided it was more confusing that way, on the grounds that it was confusing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and I knew what it was meant to be&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation: &lt;code&gt;re.sub&lt;/code&gt; lets you pass a function as the thing to replace with, rather than just a string. So we find all examples of &lt;code&gt;{loop something}...{endloop}&lt;/code&gt; in the passed string, look up &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; in the &amp;#8220;context&amp;#8221;, or the dict of substitution variables you passed to &lt;code&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/code&gt;, and then we call &lt;code&gt;LoopTemplate&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, once per item in &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; (which is expected to be a list), and pass it the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; as its string and the next item in &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; as its context. So it all works. Of course, there&amp;#8217;s no error handling or anything &amp;#8212; if &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t present in the context, or if it&amp;#8217;s not a list, or if you stray in any other way from the path of righteousness, it&amp;#8217;ll incomprehensibly blow up. So don&amp;#8217;t do&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Brum tech pub crawl 2019</title><link href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2019/12/19/brum-tech-pub-crawl-2019/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-19T15:35:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-19T15:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>sil</name></author><id>tag:www.kryogenix.org,2019-12-19:/days/2019/12/19/brum-tech-pub-crawl-2019/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for the Birmingham tech pub crawl!

&lt;p&gt;This is called a pub crawl, but it&amp;#8217;s really an excuse to get together, hang out, have a couple of drinks &amp;#8212; alcoholic or not, that&amp;#8217;s entirely up to you and there&amp;#8217;s no pressure &amp;#8212; in various places around the Jewellery Quarter. (There was discussion of being in the city centre, or in Digbeth, but since it&amp;#8217;s a Saturday and we want to talk rather than scream over the music, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JQ&lt;/span&gt; it is.) Get away from the turkey and chill out and meet people. Bring your family and your friends along. Pop in for an hour while you&amp;#8217;re in town and say hello, or show up at 12 noon and still be there at midnight, it&amp;#8217;s up to you. Lots of people come at various points during the day, and it&amp;#8217;s all very friendly, so if you don&amp;#8217;t think you know anyone, or you&amp;#8217;re on your own, that&amp;#8217;s not a problem. Come, chat to people, have a drink, have a laugh. The agenda this year is, roughly, six different places and a couple of hours in each, so we move around a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s all in the Jewellery Quarter so there&amp;#8217;s not a lot of walking. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling unsure do feel free to ping me &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sil"&gt;@sil&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter &amp;#8212; and I can tell you where we are, and I&amp;#8217;ll try to keep things updated during the&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is welcome, and everyone is invited. Bring friends along; drink coffees or soft drinks; pop in for an hour; whatever you fancy. Tell everyone about your pressies, talk about all the tech you thought about over the Christmas period, or don&amp;#8217;t talk about technology at all and just enjoy hanging out with your mates. Looking forward to seeing you&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rough&amp;nbsp;agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Lord Clifden, 12pm - 2pm (they do food if you fancy&amp;nbsp;lunch)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Church, 2pm -&amp;nbsp;4pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1000 Trades, 4pm -&amp;nbsp;6pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Rose Villa Tavern, 6pm - 8pm (probably grab a bite to eat here if we haven&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;already)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Queen&amp;#8217;s Arms, 8pm -&amp;nbsp;10pm&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s from The Official Slacker Handbook by Sarah Dunn, which I painstakingly tracked down and purchased a second-hand paper copy of to find this, and it&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Order of Illuminati, killed George Washington and served himself as our first president for two terms. The Illuminati are ultimately responsible for the French Revolution, the Bolshevik revolution, the American Revolution, the Pope, the Kennedy assassination, the Manson family, the Rockefeller dynasty, the numbers 5, 17, and 23, the New Age movement, the Nazis, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFO&lt;/span&gt; visitations, the Universal Price Code, and the pyramid with the eye on the back of the dollar bill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No comment on whether I believe any of this, but of course that&amp;#8217;s just what they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; you to think.&amp;nbsp;Fnord.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
