		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>In January my daughter Niamh starts school. So today people from the
school came round for a home visit. Basically it’s done so they can ask
her questions: they asked her to count, to recognise some written
numbers, to write her name, to draw a picture of herself, that sort of
thing. I assume that they also wanted to take a quick glance around the
house to ensure that we weren’t keeping her in horrendous squalor, which
we aren’t, much as my mum might like to think that we don’t tidy up
enough. What I want to talk about, though, is reading ability.<br>
You see, we’ve been teaching her to read. It’s going pretty slowly, as
you can imagine, but she can sound out letters and, given a bit of
prompting, put them together into words. This is <em>phonics</em>, a dirty word
in the argot of teaching children things, but it’s what both Sam and I
know. I’m quite prepared to believe that the “whole language” sort of
method might be good, but I don’t know how to teach it. Now, the nursery
that Niamh currently attends write a Record of Achievement (or some such
named thing) which is a summary of her academic progress to date.
Apparently it would seem that the school completely ignore this and
start teaching everything right from the beginning, leaving one to
wonder whether the nursery might as well have just let her play with
toys solidly for two years: the school have given her a couple of books
with pictures. No words, just pictures. She graduated from picture-books
to books with words in (which she has read to her, and reads along to
some extent) some considerable time ago.<br>
Even that, though, is not the main point here. Dm <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002850.html">comments, over on
Crooked Timber</a> (first comment after tha main article) that “the
teaching technique used was far less important than whether or not
students arrived at school knowing what books were and how they worked“.
You might think that that’s a ridiculous statement, but it isn’t. Three
years ago, a woman from Sainsbury’s visited the toddlers’ group that
Niamh attended with news of a great special offer: Sainsbury’s were, in
an effort to help literacy, giving away free children’s books! All you
had to do was go to the store and pick them up; you didn’t even need to
buy anything. Needless to say, we went, and got a rather nice cloth bag
with five or six books for very young children in it. No problem, right?
Except that, without fail, all the mothers who turned up with children
in tow to get the free books were in nice middle-class families and
really didn’t need them.We’re just the same. We have loads of books.
Niamh has loads of books. The people who this kind of thing is <em>aimed</em>
at, those who don’t have books in the house, wouldn’t dream of buying
any, don’t visit libraries: they didn’t turn up. And why? Because they
don’t care about books. That’s why they don’t have any, and so if they
feel like that why would they ever want to turn up somewhere and get
some? So it didn’t work at all, despite being done with the best of
intentions. The real horror, for me, was the reasoning behind the need
for the scheme, and something to which dm alludes in the comment linked
above: apparently, there are now a non-insubstantial proportion of kids
turning up to school at the age of five who do not know what a book
<strong>is</strong>. Not “are unable to read”—they’ve quite possibly never even seen
a book, and don’t know what to do with it. They’ll pick it up and shake
it, or chew it, or wave it around. I find it almost impossible to
conceive of a five-year-old child who doesn’t know what a book is. They
might not be able to <em>read</em> it, but they should know that reading is
what you do with it when you’ve got it. I was horrified; really,
seriously horrified at this.<br>
Obviously, Niamh is not one of these&nbsp;children.</p>
