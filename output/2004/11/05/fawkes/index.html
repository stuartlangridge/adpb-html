Today is Guy Fawkes Day, also known as Bonfire Night, the day in which
we, the citizens of the <span class="caps">UK</span>, celebrate the life and death of the only man
in history to enter Parliament with completely honest intentions. Guy
Fawkes: tried to blow up the House of Commons. Now, that sort of thing
is, admittedly, Not Cricket, but you’ve gotta admire the largeness of
the bloke’s thoughts.

<p>&#8230;and the rest, as the man said, is history. I wonder what dear old
perfidious Albion would be like if he’d succeeded? The view from
Westminster Bridge would be quite a bit crapper, I expect, as would the
opening credits of News at Ten. Still, we can’t have everything. Can’t
even have anything, some days.<br>
Which is a neat segue away from the topic of politics (of which
everyone is bored anyway) and into Ubuntu Linux, which has also been
failing me recently (much as did Fawkes 399 years ago: big celebrations
next year!). In particular, while I’ve been impressed with Ubuntu’s
looks and easy installation and basic stuff, I recently actually tried
to <em>do</em> something with it. Two things, in fact: plug in a
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">USB</span></span> pen drive, and browse to a Windows share.
Neither worked. Plugging in teh pen drive did, apparently, nothing.
Reading @/var/log/messages@ made it clear that the kernel had recognised
it and identified it as @/dev/sda@, but Ubuntu utterly failed to then
mount this device. The “Removable Storage” applet (which is actually
<code>gnome-volume-manager</code>, as far as I’m aware) has “mount removable media
when inserted” and so on, and it didn’t happen. What I’d expect to
happen is for a mount point to be created for the drive and the drive to
be mounted on that mount point, and then (at base) for a new drive to
appear in “Drives“, or (better) that <em>and</em> an icon appear on the
desktop, and (best of all) the drive to be called “<span class="caps">USB</span> Pen Drive” or the
name of the manufacturer or something rather than “sda” or
“hal-disk-3-1” or something equally meaningless. In fact, none of these
things happened. That’s not very good, and it’s obviously not a fault
with the kernel setup because that <em>worked</em>. Yes, it might be a fault
with hotplug or something, but Ubuntu and Gnome 2.8 are meant to make
this sort of thing Just Work, and they failed dismally. In the end I had
to create a mount point and mount it myself from the command line, which
is pretty alarmingly arse. Perhaps I didn’t have something installed,
but I can’t see why this shouldn’t work as part of the install,
especially since I was upgraded to the Warty release.<br>
Secondly, browsing to Windows shares in Nautilus doesn’t work. Not even
a little bit. It doesn’t even seem to understand smb:// URLs, let alone
show anything under “Windows Network” in “Network“. This is also very
pants indeed. PLus it means that I can’t print anything from my laptop,
because I can’t find the printer (which is connected to a Windows box).
Again, maybe I’ve not installed something (smbfs wasn’t installed, and I
wondered if installing that would fix it, but it didn’t) but I shouldn’t
have to; isn’t this sort of thing pretty basic functionality?<br>
So, Ubuntu fails on the “actually do something” test rather than the
“start it up and browse the web a bit” test, which isn’t good. Plus,
there seems to be something wrong with the applet that lets me configure
my network cards; half the time it locks up, and it refused to configure
the wireless card to come up at boot, so I had to edit
@/etc/network/interfaces@. Now, I’m aware that warty is an early
release, and I have no major problem with stuff not working; it just
means that (and the Ubuntu team might well entirely agree here) that
it’s perhaps not as ready for prime-time just yet as I have been
thinking it&nbsp;was.</p>
