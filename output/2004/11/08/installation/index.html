<blockquote>
<p>As is customary, the background image helpfully includes the
“installation instructions” (if you can even call them that). [ <em>those
being “drag the icon to your application folder to install”—sil</em> ]</p>
<p>I’m pointing these things out not because Delicious Monster is unique
among Mac developers in the quality of their artwork and their
attention to detail, but because they aren’t unique. Nearly every
popular Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> application is a
single-icon drag-installed affair, sporting an attractive icon,
distributed in either an internet-enabled or meticulously decorated
and arranged disk image. Even open source applications like Fire and
multi-platform ports like Mozilla meet this standard on
<span class="caps">OS X</span>. Heck, even Real gets it right. Real
software…think about that!</p>
<p>The is an example of the best kind of peer pressure. There is simply a
“climate of excellence” on the Mac platform. Any developer that does
not live up to community standards is looked down upon, or even
shunned. Commercial, open source, freeware, shareware, it doesn’t
matter: pay attention to detail, or else.</p>
<p>Windows users, think about what your typical download and installation
experience is like. How many dialogs are you presented with? What do
the file names and icons look like? Do you have to run an installer?
What kind of manual clean-up is required afterwards?</p>
<p>Linux users, when you look at the carefully laid out disk image
contents in the screenshot and links above, think about how far
“desktop Linux” has to come before it can even begin to think about
details like how single-icon drag-installed applications are arranged
in their disk image windows.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, all of this is “pointless” and “dumb” because looks are
meaningless. It’s the software that counts—the code, the bits, not the
packaging, right? And so we come to an important difference between
Mac enthusiasts and other computer users. Mac users understand that
the packaging counts too (and are willing to pay for it). Happily, you
get a lot of nice things “for free” on the Mac platform these days:
composited windows, large icons, rich disk image and application
bundle standards, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And why don’t we have this on Linux? Well, the <a href="http://rox.sf.net/">ROX Desktop</a> <em>does</em>, which is why I always liked it so much; it
just doesn’t have a lot of the other stuff that makes a good desktop
environment, and it doesn’t have enough applications (or enough
developers). And we’re not going to get it on Linux either, not with the
packaging system in the mess that it is. Now, one big hope for sorting
out packaging (if you ignore everyone saying “make Red Hat and SuSE use
.debs”—Jono, I’m looking at you here) is <a href="http://autopackage.org/">autopackage</a>. And <a href="http://autopackage.org/faq.html">what do
they say about single-drag-and-drop installation?</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s wrong with NeXT style appfolders?<br>
 One of the more memorable features of NeXT based systems like MacOS X
or GNUstep is that applications do not have installers, but are
contained within a single “appfolder“, a special type of directory
that contains everything the application needs. To install apps, you
just drag them into a special Applications folder. To uninstall, drag
them to the trash can. This is a beguilingly easy way of managing
software, and it’s a common conception that Linux should also adopt
this mechanism. I’d like to explain why this isn’t the approach that
autopackage takes to software management.<br>
 ...<br>
 Update: As of 21st May 2003 I’d consider AppFolders broke on MacOS as
it appears that most Mac software is now shipped using installers,
even Apples own software. Wise is also forging a business in
InstallShield style wrappers. It seems they really are too simple at
this stage in the game, even for the Mac.</p>
