<p>I’m with an internet bank. They’re a pain in the arse, for two reasons.
The second is that it’s a real pain to pay in cash or cheques into the
account there, because you have to send them away or pay them into
another account and then bank transfer the money, and we do that all the
time, and it’s really annoying!. The first and most important reason is
that we told then that we had a payment going out and asked them to
transfer a fiver (just a fiver) off the credit card into our current
account, so that the payment could be made (we were about 40p short in
the account of being able to make it). We asked them if the payment from
the CC would clear that night, in order to be ready for the payment to
go out the following day, and they assured us yes, repeatedly. So, the
next day, the payment went out and was rejected because there wasn’t
enough money in our account. I got on the phone to the, bleeding out of
my ears with fury, and they told me that they process outgoing payments
before they process incoming payments. Now, that not only means that
they lied to us about whether it’d work, but there is <strong>no</strong> reason to
process outgoing payments before incoming ones other than to screw
people like they did us. They could just as easily process incoming
before outgoing and then fewer people would go into an unauthorised
overdraft, but then of course they couldn’t hit as many people with
unauthorised overdraft fees. So they’re deliberately mean to sting
people for money. Fuck that. Moreover, the outgoing payment was the
first direct debit for the car insurance, and, because the first one was
rejected by the bank, the insurance company automatically cancelled the
direct debit and made us pay the whole year’s fees in one lump sum. So i
had to find a few hundred quid at no notice at all, and when I later
asked the bank for an overdraft to get that money they told me I
couldn’t have one because i was a bad credit risk.  </p>
<p>It would clearly be a horrible piece of libel for me to tell you, my
readers, that the bank is <a href="http://www.if.com/">Intelligent Finance</a>, so I won’t.</p>
