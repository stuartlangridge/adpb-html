			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">Here’s a billion-dollar question: Why are Windows users besieged by security exploits, but Mac users are&nbsp;not?</a>  </p>
<p>John Gruber states that “Mac users don’t tolerate shit”: the reason
that there is no adware or spyware for Macs is not that “Windows has a
bigger market share“, but that “If some ‘freeware’ software for the Mac
surreptitiously installed some sort of adware/spyware/crapware, there’d
be reports all over the Mac web within days. Uninstallation instructions
would be posted (and thus made available to all via Google), and the
developer who shipped the app would be&nbsp;excoriated.”  </p>
<p>I agree. Exactly the same arguments work for Linux, too, which doesn’t
have any adware or spyware or crapware&nbsp;either.  </p>
<p>The reason this works is because there is a Mac community, in the same
way as there is a Linux community. There simply aren’t all that many Mac
users who use their machine for everything that they do and don’t read
Mac websites in some way. There are, I don’t doubt, plenty of people at
work using Macs who don’t, but then using a machine at work is not the
same at all as using one at home; for one, it’s considerably unlikely
that you’d install a filesharing application on&nbsp;it.  </p>
<p>Take a glance at my own personal <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/02/12/famous">home of the moron</a> – a page which
attracts posters who want to be rich and famous. How many of those
people are using Macs or Linux? There’s a big class of people out there
who I forget about, who see their computer as a thing with which they
can talk to their friends with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MSN</span></span>, who read
their email with Hotmail, who characterise problems as “My Windows is
broken“. As Gruber says, “Many Windows users are simply resigned to the
fact that their computers contain software that is not under their
control…They’ll tolerate an annoying application that badgers them with
pop-up ads“. People who have chosen to use a Mac are not like this, but
they’ve made some kind of decision about their choice of technology, and
that kind of choice is unknown to the people posting to my “how to be
rich and famous” page. They don’t even know that there are choices.
Since, by definition, anyone using a Mac has to have made a specific
choice to do so (since Windows is the default, with its 90% market
share) they are, also by definition, not part of a group who don’t know
about choice in&nbsp;technology.  </p>
<p>If the Mac and Linux had users like that, then I think that there would
be crapware for the Mac and Linux. Currently, they do not, but I fear we
are rather complacent. Gruber talks about how Windows crapware that
wants to launch automatically can hide itself in a myriad places, and
the Mac has no equivalent for most of those places. I’ll be honest, I
doubt that that’s true; there are probably more places (Run and RunOnce
in the Registry, win.ini, the Startup folder, autoexec.bat) but not that
many more. Moreover, quite possibly most Mac users do not know about the
places on the Mac where autostarting crapware can hide, but they would
have enough nous to know that there was a place where it would be, even
if they don’t know where that place is. To people without even that
level of technical knowledge, trying to explain what a folder is is an
exercise in complexity. Trying to explain what the Registry is is an
exercise in&nbsp;futility.  </p>
<p>What if crapware installed a link to itself in your own .bashrc? Does
that only get run when you start the Terminal? How easy would it be to
explain that to Mac users without Unix knowledge?<br />
I think that both the Mac and Linux have a better setup than Windows,
and that they are inherently less vulnerable to crapware in general.
However, I also think people are mistaking “there isn’t any at the
moment” for “they are totally invulnerable“, and that’s not the case,
and if either had 90% market share (or even 50% market share; I’ll
settle for splitting the market with Mac people, that’ll do) then we’d
discover just how invulnerable they&nbsp;are.</p>
