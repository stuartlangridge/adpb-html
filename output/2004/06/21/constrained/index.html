			<p>Matt <a href="http://www.webeditorblog.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/06/21#linux_arguments_are_boring_part_2">responded</a> to <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/06/21/boringDoing">my thoughts on Gnome’s approach</a> with a
discussion of the nature of&nbsp;choice:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gnome is free to innovate and show the world that there are better
ways of doing things, but at the same time, exercise some of their own
community’s rhetoric and give people a choice. The idea that it’s okay
for Gnome to deprive their users of choice over the way they use their
computer, is another reason that the Linux world is annoying me at the
moment…Why should it be an all or nothing decision, for a user to
make? &#8230; If Gnome is the best system for a person, corporation or
whatever, except that the extra training required because of the
spatial approach makes it unviable, why do people have to ditch an
entire, very well developed desktop&nbsp;environment?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notion of choice, that you can combine different bits into a desktop
of your choice, custom-built by you for you, has been the war-cry of
Linux since there first <em>was</em> a Linux desktop. I think, though, that
it’s a pipe-dream, and the quest for this pipe-dream has hurt the
development of the Linux desktop beyond measure. In an ideal world, a
utopia of development, we’d have open and defined standards that
everyone implemented, and those standards would define how individual
components could slot together to form the perfect desktop.
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> applications would work on a Gnome
desktop; Gnome applications would work on a
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> desktop. Currently, they do not—while you
can <em>run</em> them, they use different <span class="caps">UI</span> guidelines, different
configuration databases, different inter-application
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">RPC</span></span> methods. The pipe-dream is that
organisations like <a href="http://freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</a> can define these interoperability
standards and give us our utopia. But I can’t see how that’s going to
happen. Let’s take the example of a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span>
application which needs to interoperate perfectly with a Gnome desktop.
It should, when a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">URL</span></span> is clicked, start up the
browser that the user has configured as their browser. Now, it can
either ask the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> configuration mechanism (as
it currently does), it can ask the Gnome mechanism, it can ask the
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> mechanism which (under the covers) asks
the Gnome mechanism, or it can ask some kind of abstraction layer which
knows how to ask both the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> and Gnome
mechanisms. If the freedesktop people specify a One True Config
Approach, and it’s gconf (which it looks to me like they’re gearing up
to do), how likely is it that the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> people
will start using it? And that’s just “how to find a web browser“. This
is why I suggested, in <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/guide.php">LugRadio episode five</a>, that we should abandon
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> and concentrate our development work on
Gnome. While the ideal of infinitely-pluggable desktop components would
be great, I really can’t see it ever happening. To put it another way,
if <span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> applications and Gnome applications and
non-desktop-integrated-applications all work the same way, to the same
<span class="caps">UI</span> guidelines, using the same configuration databases and the same
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">RPC</span></span> technology, haven’t we then essentially
created one desktop environment anyway?<br />
Further, <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=353">Jono has also weighed in on the debate</a> with some ideas on
Gnome’s status as a&nbsp;framework:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></span> is not written to be installed by the
regular Joe – it is intended as a framework that distributors assemble
to target their audience. This may mean tweaking the magic GConf key
and turning the spatial Nautilus off, but that is the choice of the
distributor…This is an area where <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></span> and
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> are distinctly different – the
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></span> guys are pushing for real and
different innovative features, whereas the
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> folks are simply taking any feature and
providing an off switch in the Control Center. I would love to see
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span> become more framework orientated such as
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">GNOME</span></span>…The greatest sound engineers never add
more bass/mid/treble to a sound, they simply take the other
frequencies&nbsp;out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that I view Gnome as a framework in quite the way Jono is
describing, but I’m in wholehearted agreement about Gnome’s innovative
approach as opposed to (an apparent) stagnation in
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">KDE</span></span>.<br />
I can’t imagine how a preference to turn on and turn off the spatial
Nautilus, as an example, would be anything other than confusing. (I
appreciate that Matt isn’t talking about this specific example but more
the general problem, but the point still stands.) Where would such a
preference be? It would be confusing if you don’t know what it means,
and it would encourage people to turn it off without trying it. Jono
himself has <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/viewcomments.php?id=347">been complimentary about the spatial Nautilus</a>,
suggesting off-line that he didn’t think it would be a good idea but has
since found it to be a better system. This all boils down to the
problem: if you know better than the users, how much do you enforce
that? If you enforce it <em>too</em> much, then you’re restricting choice, and
god help you if you’re wrong. If you don’t enforce it enough, then
you’re missing a chance to really <em>help</em> your users even though they
don’t know that they need&nbsp;help.</p>
