			<p>Remember when I was <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/08/12/allergic">allergic to work</a>? It seems it wasn’t work. A few
days ago it happened again. I think it’s some kind of heat rash thing.
It is most disturbing.<br>
And then last night it happened for a third time. So I went to have a
cold shower, based on my new “it’s a heat rash” theory. Didn’t seem to
help. Did I mention last time that it’s the most itchy thing imaginable?
Anyway, it was amazingly hot and oppressive inside the house, so I took
an antihistamine and sat in the back garden. Just wearing a towel around
my waist, no less; I am glad my garden has high fences. I didn’t feel
any better at all; I felt really, really, really hot, and my heart was
racing, and the blood was roaring in my ears. “I am not well, am I?“, I
thought. So I got up and stepped back inside.<br>
And then I collapsed.<br>
That wasn’t a very pleasant experience.<br>
I knew I was doing it; I felt myself fall, but from a weird third-party
perspective. It didn’t occur to me to, say, <em>stop</em> myself in any way.<br>
So I got up again and staggered up the stairs to Sam. I stepped into
our bedroom and said, “Sam? Help.”<br>
And then I blacked out.<br>
Well, I assume that that’s what happened. I remember speaking those
words, and then—immediately afterwards—I heard Sam say “Stuart? Stuart?
Are you alright?” and she was bent over me and I was lying on the floor,
on the landing at the top of the stairs.<br>
That’s never happened to me before. Can’t say I like it much,
especially as I was bloody close to having fallen down the stairs.<br>
That might have hurt a bit.<br>
Anyway, I gashed my elbow rather seriously—apparently it hit the corner
of the archetrave on the way down, ripping the phone off its wall
mounting as well—and, like, I’d blacked out. I was somewhat amazed by
this.<br>
Oddly, I felt quite a bit better afterwards.<br>
So I lay in bed and rang the doctor. While waiting for him to get back
to me, I tried sitting up and had the lovely experience of feeling dizzy
and having my vision go black at the edges. That was a nice experience.
So I lay back down again, secure in the knowledge that this was clearly
the better part of valour.<br>
Apparently I have a strong reaction to antihistamines, according to the
doctor on the phone. I certainly was knocked for six last time, and this
time was worse, so I am off to see my doctor today to say: what’s going
on? Can I now not walk around my own house without fearing loss of
consciousness? I have work to do!<br>
We shall see what he&nbsp;says.</p>
