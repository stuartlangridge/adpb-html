		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Fascinating discussion over on Crooked Timber about <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001651.html">the nature of
fictional political leaders</a> such as Francis Urquhart, Harry Perkins,
Jed Bartlett, Jack Ryan, and Jim Hacker. The thesis is that the American
fictional presidents are ideals, perfect men in every way, and while
this isn’t really true I understand what the writer means. <em>El
presidente</em> in a TV programme is someone you’d vote for, someone who
engenders the thought that <em>this</em> is the way the real guy should be
doing it, and why doesn’t he get that? British PMs on screen are not in
any way like that: Urquhart is rampagingly cool but not in any way
whatsoever someone you’d vote for; Hacker is hilarious, but, again, not
a vote target. The only fictional British PM who <em>does</em> have that “he’s
my guy! why don’t the real people get it?” vibe is Harry Perkins from <em>A
Very British Coup</em> and the story isn’t about his greatness, it’s about
how he got his arse kicked by the Civil Service. I think that some of
this is about the power embedded in the office; the PM is supposed to be
literally just the prime minister: the first among equals. (Without
wishing to delve too far into political ranting, I get the impression
that this annoys the shit out of Tony.) The <span class="caps">US
</span>President has real personal power all his own; he gets to say
“Make it so“, Picard-like, much more than our PM does. So your ideal
fictional one should say “Make it so” for all the <em>right</em> reasons and on
all the right issues, and, lo, we have utopia. Political utopias are a
much rarer commodity in fiction regarding Britain; look at 1984, the
canonical book about British politics. Look at <em>V For Vendetta</em>. As
mentioned, the only potential utopic story was <em>A Very British Coup</em>,
and that’s about how a guy tried to make a utopia and got screwed!<br>
I can’t imagine the programme <em>10 Downing Street</em>, the UK equivalent of
<em>The West Wing</em>. I think that Americans see politics as a
knife-in-the-back grubby business and chastise their politicians for not
being the Platonic form of a perfect politician. Here, on the other
hand, no-one really expects politicians to be virtuous—the complaints
come about when a politician shows explicit <em>un</em>-virtuousness, but if
they exhibit the status quo of not being explicitly nasty but not being
nice either, no-one thinks twice about it. Politics is a grubby business
and politicians don’t care about us. There are, notably, exceptions, but
they’re not exceptions who are doing what everyone <em>expects</em> of
politicians (and therefore everyone else is falling down on the job),
they’re exceptions who rise above the norm and the expectation.</p>
