		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>This weekend, <a href="http://www.1976design.com/">Dunstan Orchard</a> opened up his house to five
<a href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20040227175230.xml" title="'Whatever the collective noun for blogger is', as Jeremy puts it">visitors</a>: myself, <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon</a>, <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy</a>, and <a href="http://www.clagnut.com/">Richard</a>. So
we drank a lot, and ate rather exceptionally well (and who’d have
thought you could make a pizza base from shortcrust pastry? I’ll be
trying that one) and did weird activities.<br>
For example, what were you doing at 1am on Sunday morning? I bet you
weren’t in a field <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/02/29/light-angel/" title="this is my new default picture of me">turning your companions into angels</a>. Or at least,
if you were, it was of your own choice and I bet that your feet weren’t
as cold as ours. <em>And</em>, if that wasn’t cool enough, I got to see the
<a href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/post/479">Cerne Abbas Giant</a> again, upon which many predictable remarks were
made, and I got to ~~impress~~ bewilder everyone with background
knowledge about whether it’s Helith or Hercules or Nodens or Oliver
Cromwell or just some guy with a big dick.<br>
I learned many things this weekend. For example, I learned that people
who take good photos do so by taking a lot of photos, all the time. I
was under the impression that great photographers would just be walking
along the street and see something that looked great, and whip out the
photo to immortalise it forever on ~~film~~ a big
<span class="caps">JPEG</span>. Not so! At first, I thought that perhaps
great photography had been reduced to the Shakespearian Monkey technique
of just taking pictures of everything and throwing away all the crap
ones. However, this is also not so: there’s something of both. I wish I
had the artistic ability to notice stuff that would look cool; the guys
took pictures of gravestones, of cherry blossom, of grass, and I’d never
even think to try that. This, I suppose, is why I’m not a very good
designer!<br>
I also learned that loads of people have Macs—at least, loads of people
who are designers have Macs. Having seen a couple up close and personal
this weekend, though, I’m not revising my current opinion, which is that
they seem pretty cool and look <em>very</em> pretty but they’re not worth the
money and I’ll stick with Linux. I want a nice light laptop to carry
around all the time, though.<br>
More learning experiences: the first stage of finding out about stuff
is still to Google for it, but the second stage is to IM someone who
might know. I’ve got half a dozen people in my IM friends list, so I
shall be adding to that—if you run IM stuff and don’t mind being
contacted, let me know!<br>
Oh, and I learned about Dunstan’s dog, Poppy, who is very amusingly
hyperactive, but also repugnant and malodorous at times; Dunstan doesn’t
mind this (being, as he is, <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Health/Senses/Smell_and_Taste/Anosmia/" title="it means 'having no sense of smell'">anosmic</a>), and about a neat idea for
another bit of Javascript weirdness which I shall write as soon as I get
a chance.<br>
Great bunch of guys, especially when they look like angels. Thanks,
all.</p>
