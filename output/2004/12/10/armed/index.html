			<p>“What they could and did do was send a powerful message that this city
was now an armed camp and that those with the arms would do as they
pleased and the rest of us would just have to deal with it. For many New
Yorkers, it was like living under occupation…One man got into an
argument with a captain who told him to get moving. When the man asked
for the captain’s shield number, he was arrested. Just like that…It was
weird seeing this kind of thing right in front of you and not on a TV
program about some distant land where freedom is merely a
concept…Strange as it may seem, this was the most pleasant part of the
whole ordeal. The police were almost friendly as they tied our hands
behind our backs with thick plastic tie wraps…“I’ve got five bodies down
the hall to move into a cell,” they would say. Perhaps that dehumanized
the detainees to them but it made us feel more human than ever. At least
it did at that point…It’s a nifty concept – I’ll bet if they arrested
the entire city, they’d find enough wanted criminals to get some people
to actually support the idea…As we moved down that hallway, I heard the
hoarse voice of a female detainee from behind the wall crying out for a
lawyer. I was sickened when I realized that it was the same voice I had
heard there twelve hours before.”  </p>
<p>What is wrong with America that <a href="http://www.2600.com/rnc2004/index.html">1200 or so people were swept off the streets of Manhattan by the police</a> on August 31st 2004? They’re the
land of the free, fergawdsake: what’s going on?<br>
