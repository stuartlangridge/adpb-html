			<p>A while back I wrote about how <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/10/16/browsing">the tyranny of tabbed browsing</a> leaves
you with a load of interesting links left open in tabs that you haven’t
got time to write a post about but can’t close because you so <em>want</em> to
post about them. I have since alleviated that problem. Instead, the
tyrant in my life is Bloglines’ “Keep New” function. I’m subscribed to
about 120 feeds in Bloglines, and when I find something that I want to
write something about, I tick “Keep New” so it stays unread. Repeat for
a few months and I now permanently have twelve things that are in need
of exposition. The difference, I suppose, is that since I built the
linklog, these are not quick dash-off-a-note-and-snarky-comment items,
but things deserving of a real discusrive post, which they just aren’t
going to get. Not unless I get a lot less busy, anyway. So, here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.delimiter.org/2004_11.html">i’ll replace you with machines</a> – I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.delimiter.org/">Delimiter</a>
    for a while without actually realising that it was Scott Andrew.
    Amazing. Anyway, Scott bemoans his lack of that essential something
    that keeps his weblog running, especially the technical
    <span class="caps">DHTML</span>/JS/etc bits of it. What is the
    <em>something</em>? I know how he feels: it’s partly time, partly
    inclination, partly lack of inspiration. “Yeah, there’s plenty of
    stuff out there that hasn’t been built yet, and I have no desire to
    build most of it. Why, yes, we could implement a [insert like-to-have feature here] in JavaScript. I know it can be done, you
    know it can be done — so do we really have to build it? Next!” I’ve
    seen quite a few things that I had an idea about in the past but
    never wrote up: I wish I’d carried on with Renditioner, which was an
    <span class="caps">HTML</span>/CSS/JS-based presentation package
    like Eric Meyer’s excellent S5. (I foundered on it because I was,
    and remain, convinced that it all needs to be in one file: this is
    what prompted <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/10/18/embedding">my investigations into inline images in web pages</a>
    and caused me to give up because it doesn’t work in IE.) Eric’s work
    is superlative, and I’m sure Renditioner would have been a lot more
    crufty, don’t get me wrong here.</li>
<li><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/archive/2004/Dec-14.html">Miguel the Iguana</a> notes a CyberSource <a href="http://www.cybersource.com.au/about/linux_vs_windows_tco_comparison.pdf">study on Linux vs Windows TCO</a> (caveat Acrobat), which I’d love to
    distribute at work if I thought it’d make any difference, which it
    won’t.</li>
<li>Bill Mill’s <a href="http://llimllib.f2o.org/blog/serve/delicious_game">del.icio.us game</a> is cool. Score points for how
    perspicacious you were with linking to something. It’s an amusing
    conceit which underlies a serious point, that del.icio.us is a huge
    and useful data store for what people are linking to, in a much more
    direct way than services like blogdex. It’s also changed the way
    linklogs work—I’ll probably be shifting mine over to it as part of
    the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/wiki/Redesign">Grand Site Redesign</a>—and it’s got a great
    <span class="caps">API</span>. Moreover, the
    <span class="caps">API</span> isn’t a separate bolt-on; using
    del.icio.us means that you <em>are</em> using the
    <span class="caps">API</span> directly, because it’s
    <span class="caps">RES</span>Tish. I love that. Our
    <acronym title="Customer Relationship Management"><span class="caps">CRM</span></acronym>
    product at work, <a href="http://www.interfacesoftware.com/products/interaction/ia_summary.cfm">InterAction</a> from Interface Software, is another
    excellent example of that, and at some point I will write up a
    description of its superb web <span class="caps">API</span> so that
    other people can write stuff that works like it.</li>
<li>Another example of how del.icio.us is changing how people work is
    that <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003223.html">Jeremy Z wants his own personal del.icio.us</a> to archive his
    links from emails and his browser and so on. I remain convinced that
    a trivial Firefox extension that indexes your browser history and
    makes it searchable is a very good thing to do: not like Slogger,
    which archives it all (I don’t need a separate copy of it, that’s
    what the damned web is <em>for</em>), but something which indexes it so
    that it can be searched later.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2004111109520.gif">Greatest Dilbert cartoon ever</a>. Don’t know how long that link
    will last, but the exchange is between Alice and the
    <span class="caps">PHB</span>, obviously in the context of a
    performance review: the <span class="caps">PHB</span> declares that
    Alice’s biggest defect is inability to handle criticism, which gets
    Alice’s goat, because she can’t argue with that statement without
    proving it true. Similar scenes occur in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000070.html" title="Joel Spolsky is particularly and rightly scathing of them">performance reviews</a>
    right up and down the country, every single day, and Adams lampoons
    them perfectly here. (He goes on to, ahem, hammer the point home in
    the last panel, where the <span class="caps">PHB</span> also
    complains that Alice argues with people who are much smarter than
    her, heh.) Remind me someday, in the future, to tell you about the
    ridiculous performance review scheme at work.</li>
<li>Dunstan has been busy <a href="http://1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/11/21/solving-css-problems-mozilla-europe/">coming up with cool new CSS techniques</a> for Mozilla Europe.
    Likely to be of more use to real designers than to me, I’m still
    really glad that it is still possible to innovate in ways like this.
    One of my fears about the rise of <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span>
    tools is that, if we abtract away from the complexity of
    <span class="caps">CSS</span>, then this will suddenly stop being
    possible: you’ll only be able to organise pages in ways that your
    tool makers thought of, and they won’t think of things lke this.
    (Oh, this tehcnique might be in the new version of the tool, as long
    as you think that \$99 is worth paying for it. Unless you’re using
    <a href="http://www.nvu.com/">Nvu</a> or something.) <a href="http://schwuk.com/entries/55/dont-underestimate-the-value-of-a-good-debugger">Schwuk has written about the tool/IDE debate</a> (following on from the much-linked paper on <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides">The IDE Divide</a> and what it is), commenting
    that “they’re just electric screwdrivers to me – they do the job
    faster, but you don’t need them” and summing up my own thoughts on
    the matter perfectly.</li>
<li>Seth Nickell vies in my head for Greatest Usability Guy, along with
    <a href="http://www.asktog.com/">Tog</a> and <a href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/">Matthew Thomas</a> (his <a href="http://mpt.net.nz/">new place</a> doesn’t have as
    much usability stuff). Nickell is a lot less acerbic than Thomas,
    but they’re both excellent: Nickell’s <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/usability/">Improving Usability</a> essay
    is recommended.</li>
<li>Still on usability, Drew McLellan wrote about <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/237/">Supermarket Usability</a> and questioned the very idea that the user comes first,
    given that supermarkets unashamedly put their own interests before
    those of consumers (Daniel Davies has more on <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002093.html">how supermarkets outsource their costs to the customer</a> and similar tricks) and yet
    still make a whole shitload of money.</li>
<li>Steven Garrity <a href="http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/december/featurerequest">wants the Google search box in Firefox to interact with Google Suggest</a>. I’ll bet money that the Google people will
    cut that off if someone implements it, which is a real shame…</li>
<li>Sparkes notes in <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/ubuntuGuide#au1102945757.97">a comment</a> that the Ubuntu Guide is “stolen from
    <span class="caps">GPL</span> and <span class="caps">FDL</span>
    sources with no accreditation“. I’ve had a poke around and can’t
    find many examples of direct plagiarism, but sparkes’ point about
    the licence (that the Guide can only be reproduced in full) is well
    taken, and I should not have linked to it.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/revisited#au1099427322.17">another comment here</a> Rob Annable said “we should all get off
    our lazy aRSSes and go visit some sites“, meaning that the rise of
    the agggregator means that we’re missing something essential. He’s
    not wrong, but…well, I want to mainline information. That’s what’s
    important to me. The method of delivery is a serious long way behind
    in second place. This is probably one of the reasons why I haven’t
    got the new design done yet (although that’s more properly a
    rearchitecting, and I’ll bang a new <em>look</em> on top as a fringe
    benefit).</li>
<li>Schwuk has been <a href="http://schwuk.com/entries/60/">reading ebooks</a>. Both he and <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/11118.aspx">Rory</a> do this the
    same as I: having ebooks on your mobile device is marvellous because
    you can read for five minutes while you’re standing in a queue, or
    sitting outside the shop waiting for your wife, or on the bog, or
    having a cigarette in the car park. I do these things a lot (well, I
    do the last two a lot and the other two sometimes). Fortunately (and
    thanks to the kindness of Jono) I now have a Zaurus again, so I
    don’t have to go through the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/11/30/sonyericsson">rather convoluted process of putting them on my phone for reading there</a> any more.</li>
<li>Finally, Matt has <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/blog/2004/11/marketing-jaguar-marketing-open-source.html">written up the beginnings of some thoughts on marketing Open Source software</a> with a look at Jaguar’s approach.
    Look for more on this from LugRadio in the new year…</li>
