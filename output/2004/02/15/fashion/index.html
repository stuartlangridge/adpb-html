			<p>Anyone who’s ever met me will know I am no fashionable bloke. I’m
perpetually envious of people who are, though; not (I hasten to add)
those wearing the latest catwalk creations, but people who manage to
make themselves look good in pretty much whatever they’re wearing. I’d
love, for example, a full-length leather coat. Because, in my head, I’d
look like Neo. Of course, I wouldn’t. I’d look like a second-hand car
dealer, or possibly like Colonel Von Strohm after raiding Herr Flick’s
wardrobe. Similarly, I admire t-shirts; things like the ones at <a href="http://www.tshirthell.com/hell.shtml">T-Shirt
Hell</a> (particularly the <a href="http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a247" title="rape is no laughing matter...unless you're raping a clown">clown</a> and <a href="http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a252" title="I like my women like I like my coffee -- ground up and in the freezer">coffee</a> ones), and the way
people I know can just look pretty cool in t-shirts—<a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/">Jono</a> would count
here if it wasn’t for the fact that all his t-shirts are metal. Me, I
don’t wear t-shirts. I wear shirts, almost all the time. White cotton
button-down Oxford shirts to work, <em>always</em>, and casual shirts at home.
Now, admittedly, that’s at least slightly because the top pocket gives
me somewhere to put my cigarettes, but that’s not the point. The very
word “casual” is the giveaway here. It’s a word to describe things out
of catalogues. Clothes from C&amp;A. Stuff worn to the office party by the
boss; you know those tight jeans with the ironed-in crease down the
front? That sort of thing. In fact, the only cool item of clothing I own
is my <a href="http://www.ausmanufacturers.com.au/barmah/index.html?barmah1.html~page">hat</a> and even then I’m the only person who likes it. (On the
other hand, I don’t care, because I like it.) I was walking out of work
the other day—dark night, glass doors—and caught a glimpse of myself,
reflected. I looked like nothing more than <span class="caps">G. K.</span> Chesterton, or more
accurately like Fiddler’s Green in his Chesterton persona, as Neil
Gaiman would tell you. Honestly, all I needed was a shooting stick. Now,
Chesterton was a wonderful man; a gourmet and gourmand, wit and
raconteur, wise and childlike and writer of and subject of stories and
anecdotes to make anyone laugh, and then think a bit. But he was in no
way Adonis. He was proud of that—he was once delighted to be introduced
as “Mr. Chesterton, who has been looking round in America”—but then <em>he</em>
was a successful author and broadcaster, and I’m not.<br />
I’m unclear whether any of this matters. I mean, some people just look
good in clothes. No, wait—that, er, came out wrong. Some people make
clothes look good on them; they could wear sackcloth and carry it off
well. Me, on the other hand; I could make a Savile Row suit look like
those rubbish bags that Toto Coelo used to wear. And I <em>like</em> suits; I
had a fascinating conversation with a guy at work once in the pub about
different types of suits and how they sit on you and so on. He wears a
<em>watch chain</em> and manages to get away with it, and he’s about 24.
Perfect example. So, my thought is: if you have to <em>try</em>, then you’ve
already lost; you’re the boss at the office party in his ironed jeans.
So my policy is generally to just lie down and die, to abandon all
thoughts of the subject. I mean, I have some cool clothes—what I think
are cool clothes, anyway. The hat. My summer jacket, which I can’t wear
yet because the weather’s too cold. My trenchcoat. My ordinary coat,
although it’s now battered—the hat looks better the more battered it
gets, but the coat is wool, and does not. Much more Michael Douglas than
Crocodile Dundee, sadly, and Michael Douglas clothing looks good
<em>because</em> it’s expensive and in pristine nick, because he throws it away
when it looks a bit worn. (“Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?” “That
one did.“) I, however, have the tastes and don’t have the budget for
that sort of thing. So, I can go for expensive but infrequently-bought
and therefore rather foxed and cheap-looking stuff, or trendy stuff that
doesn’t fit properly because I’m not a 19-year-old beach bum, or David
Brent clothing. Or something I haven’t thought of. Suggestions&nbsp;welcome.</p>
