			<p>Benjamin Otte <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515110500/http://blogs.gnome.org/view/otte/2007/04/20/0">writes about replacing Flash with SVG, HTML, and JavaScript</a>. It's possible -- look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515110500/http://www.openlaszlo.org/demos#LZPIX">OpenLaszlo LZPIX demo</a>
for the same app in Flash and HTML to see that it can be done -- but
there are a few things in the way. Flash has a number of advantages
which would need to be replicated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Multimedia support. YouTube and the like have recently become the
    biggest Flash users in the world, I imagine, and what makes that
    possible is Flash's support for video; similarly, there are lots of
    in-browser mp3 players (like <a href="http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/">XSPF</a>) which use Flash because of
    its support for audio. Existing play-sound-from-JavaScript projects
    like <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/">SoundManager2</a> use Flash to actually <em>play</em> the sounds. The
    WHATWG-proposed <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#video">video</a> and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#audio">audio</a> elements will
    provide this in the browser eventually, assuming that they're
    actually implemented and we can get around the issues of what video
    formats are supported (Apple are lobbying hard for video format
    support to not be mandated, meaning that the element will be broadly
    useless on the web itself -- Safari will support QuickTime-supported
    videos, IE will support WMV, Firefox and Opera will support Ogg
    Theora). This is a big problem, but there are tentative steps toward
    solving it.</li>
<li>Single-file deployment. Once you've made a Flash file it's one file
    -- <code>whatever.swf</code>. That's highly easy to deploy. It will be possible
    to make single-file deployments of a scripting+SVG+HTML+images
    bundle, but it's harder; images are a particular problem if you
    intend to support Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>An IDE. This is what Otte calls for, above, noting that animations
    require coding in an HTML+SVG+JS environment and they don't in
    Flash, and that "the best Free authoring tool is either vim or
    emacs"; not what he's suggesting that we do use, but a wry comment
    on the lack of authoring tools for standards-compliant rich web
    apps. An IDE is fairly critical to get this sort of technology out
    to the masses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ignoring the elephant in the corner of multimedia support for the moment
(but it's a big elephant, and mustn't be forgotten), everything else is
pretty much doable. Creating an IDE would be possible; SVG is available
most places now (and is <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2006/03/svg-in-ie-update/">emulable in IE</a>, and there's always the
<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, which is also <a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">emulable in IE</a>);
single-file-deployment isn't critical, really (instead of a complicated
<code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag to embed a Flash file, it's <code>&lt;iframe src="mywidget/"&gt;</code>,
with your JS/HTML/SVG widget in a folder). It'd be supported everywhere,
you wouldn't have to worry about the direction being solely controlled
by one vendor, and it uses technologies we already know rather than
trying to supplant the open web as Microsoft's Silverlight is doing.
Those of you who doubt that HTML is capable of this sort of thing, take
a look at Apple's Dashboard widgets, which do many cool things and are
pure HTML, JavaScript, and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. You might even be able to convert
existing Flash movies to it using <a href="http://flasm.sf.net/">flasm</a>, which would get the project
up and running pretty quickly. Of course, the idea needs a name. It
would be nice to have it not be named after toilet cleaner, like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070515110500/http://www.uk.pg.com/products/products/flash.html">Flash</a> or <a href="http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/HC/Products/HouseholdCleaners/Ajax.cvsp">Ajax</a>. Whoever writes the IDE gets to think of the
catchy name and be immortalised for ever. If you need a name, call it
"April". No catchy acronym, it's just a nice word, and it's when my
daughter was born. Currently desperately trying to not start writing
this.</p>
