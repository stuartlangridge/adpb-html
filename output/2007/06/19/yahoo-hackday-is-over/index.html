			<p>What a fun weekend. I had a thoroughly enjoyable time at <a href="http://hackday.org/">the Yahoo/<span class="caps">BBC</span> hack day</a> this past weekend. Dave Neary <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2007/06/18/jlm-2007/">says</a> &#8220;lightning struck
twice&#8221;, referring to how he was left out of the programme for the
conference <em>he</em> was at. Pah. Lightning did actually strike twice; the
building I was in was struck. By lightning. Twice. Excuse me while I say
that again. <strong>The building I was in was struck by lightning.</strong> Now
there&#8217;s a pretty unique experience. Although it&#8217;s hardly surprising
since <a href="http://www.jbutler.org.uk/London/Haringey/AllyPally.shtml">Alexandra Palace has a 40 metre metal mast on the roof</a> which
looks like the Eiffel Tower and probably weighs about ninety tons.
Rumours abound that Google&#8217;s new weather <span class="caps">API</span> is actually a <em>writeable</em>
<span class="caps">API</span>. If it were, it&#8217;d probably look something like Simon&#8217;s <a href="http://simonwillison.net/static/2007/smite.html">Google Smite</a>. To be honest, the bolt hit the building just as I and a couple
of others were slagging off Microsoft Silverlight. Draw what conclusions
you&nbsp;will.</p>
<p><em>The roof panels open after the lightning strike, allowing cool
refreshing rain to land on everyone&#8217;s&nbsp;laptops</em></p>
<p>Aside from inadvertent electrical events, a lot, lot, lot else happened.
There were many cool hacks done with the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and Yahoo APIs, <a href="http://icant.co.uk/webstandardsforbusiness/pmwiki.php/main/HackDay">seventy in total</a>; I think my favourite was
<a href="http://fruitr.co.uk/">Fruit</a><span style="color:#ff0084">r</span>, which identified pictures
of fruit that you emailed it and then suggested mad recipes in which to
use it. Other&nbsp;highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeremy Keith, Nat Downe, and others actually working really hard for
    the entire weekend and coming up with <a href="http://hackday07.tokofu.com/">Hackfight</a>, Top Trumps
    where your scores are based on how many twitters you&#8217;ve done, how
    high your Technorati rating is, that sort of thing. So it&#8217;s a game
    where you can find out who&#8217;s the biggest gimp. Cool hack, mind.&nbsp;:-)</li>
<li>Me trying to make sense of Simon Willison&#8217;s <a href="http://oxfordgeeks.net/">Oxford Geeks</a> code
    and build a Birmingham Geeks site around it in one hour. And then
    discovering that the git depended on <em>all of Django</em> just so he
    could use its template engine for one 10-line template file. Good&nbsp;one.</li>
<li>I am going to set up Birmingham Geeks, though, so if you&#8217;re in this
    area leave a comment or something and when I do it you can see how
    to get on there. This will finally give me an excuse to go and have
    a beer with Bruce Lawson, which I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for about
    six&nbsp;months.</li>
<li>Travelling down on the train with Matthew Somerville and finding out
    about all the cool stuff that MySociety are doing, including a
    wicked cool hack with the <span class="caps">BBC</span> Parliament videos that I&#8217;m really
    hoping to see&nbsp;happen.</li>
<li>The wi-fi being constantly shit for all of the first day, even
    before the whole building was zapped. Pretty coloured circles on the
    Cisco wi-fi access points, though. Has anyone ever done a conference
    where the wi-fi worked properly? (Yes, I know about the Pycon&nbsp;writeup.)</li>
<li>Having two people come up and ask me if I was me based on
    recognising my voice from LugRadio. Cool. LugRadio Live is in three
    weeks, remember,&nbsp;people!</li>
<li>Meeting up with some people I hadn&#8217;t seen for a while and meeting
    some for the first&nbsp;time</li>
<li>Getting hassle from Christian Heilmann <em>again</em> about moving to
    London and working for Yahoo. I&#8217;m not moving to London, dude. Open a
    Birmingham office! Embrace telecommuting! It is the 21st century!&nbsp;:-)</li>
<li>I got pretty pissed off with my laptop, mind, which is fine when
    sitting on my desk but, what with it being stuffed full of
    proprietary hardware (listen to <a href="http://lugradio.org/episodes/80">this week&#8217;s LugRadio</a> for more on
    that) doesn&#8217;t work very well on the wireless (having to reboot to
    make it re-detect it five or six times a day, grr), hibernate
    properly, or work with a projector without rebooting. I need a
    conference laptop which doesn&#8217;t have a load of undocumented Broadcom
    and <span class="caps">ATI</span> hardware in it and doesn&#8217;t weigh very much. I must try and
    find a very cheap second-hand one&nbsp;somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>People hide their laptops from the rain with umbrellas inside. An
unusual sort of&nbsp;sight.</em></p>
<p>It was great. I did think about putting some hacks together but, to be
honest, I was enjoying chatting away and meeting back up with people so
much that I didn&#8217;t really get around to much actual coding. Simon was
kind enough to credit the London Geeks stuff he did to &#8220;The
Oxford-Birmingham-Kansas alliance&#8221;, with me being the Birmingham third
of that, but that&#8217;s about all. I do have a plan for making Jackfield
support Yahoo widgets, mind. Oh, and I helped out a very small amount
with Gerv Markham and Ewan Spence&#8217;s rocket launcher, which was
entertaining in itself and provided more than one laugh on the day.  Good work, Yahoo and the <span class="caps">BBC</span>. I have
no idea whether the weekend met any of the goals you had for it, but
you&#8217;ve convinced five hundred people that (a) you&#8217;re good companies, (b)
there are many APIs out there which need mashing up, (c) it is possible
to live for two days on Twixes and nervous energy, and (d) the world
needs more weekends like this. When&#8217;s the next one? Bring it&nbsp;on.</p>
