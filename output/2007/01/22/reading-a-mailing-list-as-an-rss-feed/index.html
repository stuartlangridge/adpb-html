		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>There are a couple of low-ish traffic mailing lists that I'd like to
read in my feed reader, because I really only want to pay attention to
what's posted, rather than follow up. I'm aware that this sort of
behaviour is poison to building a community around a mailing list, but I
really need this for -announce type lists, where there's no community
anyway. What this of course means is that I need a way of converting a
mailing list to an RSS feed. Fortunately, someone's ahead of me on this:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070122110100/http://www.throwingbeans.org/">Tom Dyson</a> has set up <a href="http://www.mailbucket.org/">MailBucket</a>, which makes this whole process
pretty easy. Simply subscribe <code>some-email-address@mailbucket.org</code> to the
mailing list, and then an RSS feed of that list is available at
<code>http://mailbucket.org/some-mailing-list</code>. Nice job! You'll need to take
a glance at the feed after you've done the subscription, because most
lists these days require some form of confirmation. Lists being run with
the Mailman software are easy to handle, because their "please confirm
your subscription" message contains a URL for you to visit to confirm
it, which you can do. If you want to subscribe to a list which requires
you to send an email from <code>some-email-address@mailbucket.org</code> to confirm
subscription then it might be a bit more tricky; I don't know how to do
that, but maybe Tom can help you. I've just used it to subscribe to the
<a href="http://www.openmoko.com/">OpenMoko</a> announce list, so I can find out when the all-new exciting
OpenMoko phone becomes available. Looks suspiciously like an Apple
iPhone, except it's been in development for longer than since MacWorld
so it must be independent invention. And it's a completely open
platform; runs Linux and X.org. I've been thinking about getting a new
phone, since my <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/11/17/i-need-a-new-phone">z800i</a> is starting to die, and is a Sony phone
besides. (Bought before I really decided that I shouldn't give Sony any
of my cash, but that's not the point.) For those of you who think the
iPhone looks cool, there's a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070122110100/http://www.linuxtogo.org/gowiki/OpenMoko/iPhone">comparison between the OpenMoko phone and
the iPhone</a> available, which makes it look to me as though the iPhone
has the edge in terms of equipment (and things like multi-pointer) but
the OpenMoko is going to be available sooner and is an open platform.
Write your own software for it, which means that all of us <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070122110100/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/01/12/sharecroppers">unbeautiful
people</a> have the chance to make our phones better. If you're not
interested in that, fine; you're welcome to not buy it. Me, I like the
idea. Only <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%24350+in+gbp">£180</a> too, which isn't all that much. I want one. And now
I'll know when it's released.</p>
