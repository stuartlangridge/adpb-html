<h3><img alt="not quite me" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/cyclist.png"> I'm the bike rider, twisted bike rider</h3>
<p>Have you ever let someone talk you into trying a different text editor
or web browser than you normally use? If you have (and most people have)
then you'll be familiar with the strange sense of disorientation you get
when you do this. Someone sneaks in during the night and puts some
irremovable mittens on your hands, so when you try and work the next day
you flail at the keyboard like that boy from Kid in the Corner on a high
sugar day and get nothing done. I've been experiencing this particular
blend of confusion, frustration, and the need to stop and smoke a
cigarette just to get away from it all a lot over the last week. Nothing
to do with text editors (gedit) or web browsers (Firefox), though.
Instead, I'm doing something entirely unattached to the computer. I've
got a bike. A push bike, no less. And I ride it to the railway station
every morning. Those of you who know me might be a bit surprised at
this. I've got all the gear, too. Helmet, bike lock, water bottle,
everything. I even tuck my trousers into my socks when I'm riding so
that I don't rip my suit to shreds. It looks a lot like I'm going to
have to change my name by deed poll to Norman. Cyclists are morons in
stupid day-glo jackets. Take a brush to your bike, indeed. I'm not a
cyclist. Sadly, I'm something worse: I'm a middle-aged man worried that
he's getting too fat. I'm not sure precisely when I stopped being a
teenager full of piss and vinegar and started being someone who knows
what the Bank of England base rate is, but it's happened. I anticipate a
slow and gentle slide into a genuine appreciation of Volvo's safety
record. Of gardening, and what mulch is. Soon I'll be writing letters to
the newspaper complaining about the dangerous chicanes on the A491 and
spending my weekends walking in the rain on a hilltop with a compass and
one of those waterproof coats that folds back up into its own pocket. On
the other hand, today for the first time I managed to ride all the way
to the station without having to stop for a breather. Anyone pointing
out that my bike has 21 gears and I'm only using the lowest seven can
fuck off.  </p>
<h3><img alt="two doors" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/twodoors.png"> Usability in the real world</h3>
<p>This past weekend saw a visit to a local Chinese restaurant by a group
of us. All very nice, as ever. On leaving, there was the usual
conversation on the pavement -- why no-one ever says, look, we're going
to stand and talk for twenty minutes anyway, why don't we do it in the
bar? is beyond the ken of humanity -- and then a walk back to the car
park. Now, the restaurant is midway along the side wall of this
multi-storey, and so there are two entrances back to get your car; one
each side of the restaurant. So we spent five minutes -- I'm not
kidding, five minutes -- standing outside in the supernaturally cold
weather discussing which door to go through. When usability people say
not to offer the user two ways of doing the same thing, because <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2002-January/msg00006.html">they'll
spend longer deciding which to use than just doing it</a>, this is what
they're talking about.  </p>
<h3><img alt="pizza" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/pizza.png"> Y Viva Italia</h3>
<p>Once again, this year's summer holiday is Italy. Once again, it's the
Veneto. this year, though, the destination is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda">Lake Garda</a>. If
anyone's likely to be near there at the end of August, let me know. I'll
be the one doing his best to eat all the pizza and gnocchi in town and
repeating the word "portacenere". Unless it's portocenere. I normally
let my accent handle the confusion there.  </p>
<h3><img alt="birthday" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/m31.png"> And finally...</h3>
<p>It's my birthday. I was born a prime number of years ago (a Mersenne
prime and a lucky prime, in fact). In two years I'll be as old as Jesus,
which is something to look forward to. And the number of my years is
also the Turkish slang term for masturbation. No, I don't know why
either. Speak on, Turkish readers. Those of you who are neither Turkish
nor mathematicians (or indeed either, which would exclude Paul Erdos,
unless he was Hungarian) and therefore don't know what a Mersenne prime
is might find the golden figure easier to work out if you first of all
knew that my age is now one less than a power of two and secondly
reviewed the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/01/30/staring">2005</a>, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/31/birthdays">2004</a>, and <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/01/30/revolution">2003</a> versions of this game.
Those of you who are wholly mathematically incompetent should review the
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/30/turning-thirty">2006 version</a> and add one. If even that is beyond your abilities,
then find the nearest person to you wearing glasses and ask them for
help. I'll be busy over here putting candles on the cake.</p>
