			<p>I've just released the latest episode of LugRadio, "<a href="http://lugradio.org/episodes/85">Lock, Stock, and
One Smoking Barrel</a>", which is the second episode of season five
(five! still amazes me, that). We talked to Greg Kroah-Hartman about the
Linux Driver Project, we ruminate about online office suites and whether
they're completely pointless, about another free software project which
seems to be lost in space, and whether the open source community eats
itself alive too much, which it does (as per discussions on Planets
Gnome and Ubuntu <em>passim</em>). And, y'know, people write in to tell us we
were wrong about things (thanks Gerv!) even though we clearly weren't.
You know the score! Interestingly, though, I've been poking through my
logs for lugradio.org and associated mirrors. In the past, people have
asked (repeatedly) for an estimate of how many people listen to the
show, and I normally quote some figures I worked out a long time ago
showing that between eight and twelve thousand people grab it every two
weeks. For <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/07/10/enclosure">various reasons</a> it's quite difficult to get figures
across our mirror network and RSS and so on, but I believe I've put
these together properly. It looks like, since the old days when I worked
those numbers out, it's changed rather a lot. As far as I can tell, an
"average" episode (if there is such a thing) of LugRadio has about
20,000 people listen to it, and the most popular episodes get somewhere
around <strong>30,000 listeners</strong>. Thirty thousand! Blimey. So, I would like
to say thanks to those thirty thousand people: we love it, yes we do.
Keep on doing what you do, and we'll keep on doing what we do. Probably
this is all explained by <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1046">Bacon</a> being the <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/1447">top of the Linux bloggers
A-list</a>, although I personally have my doubts about the methodology
there (as does Don Marti, who did it). Then again, since I was sixth I
can hardly complain too much. Don't talk too much about the methodology;
just let me enjoy the warm feeling, even if it is all built on
mathematically dubious sand foundations. We march onward, indeed.</p>
