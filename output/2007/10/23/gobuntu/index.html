		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>This weekend I upgraded my machine to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu">Gobuntu</a>, the
entirely-free-software (but see below) version of Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy
Gibbon. Since I&#8217;m <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWithoutRestricted">specifically named as the use case</a> (!) it seemed
like the right thing to do. First, the good news: it all seems to be
working fine. Since I was doing a clean install (again, see below), and
because my laptop has an <span class="caps">AMD</span> Turion chip in it, I went for the 64-bit
version. (Thanks to Dave Morley for taking the time to tell me whether
the 64-bit version was worth it.) Everything works; no problems at all.
Good work, the Gobuntu team. I have a few extra things worth mentioning,
though. First, like <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/18/gobuntu-has-already-failed">Mark Pilgrim</a>, I&#8217;m disappointed that <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/83118">the issue
with Firefox&#8217;s non-free logos</a> wasn&#8217;t resolved before release.
Apparently the solution will be to replace Firefox with Epiphany, the
Gnome browser which is based on Gecko, the Firefox rendering engine. At
that point people will hopefully be able to move to the unbranded
&#8220;Firefox&#8221;, which seems to be called &#8220;Iceweasel&#8221; or something similar; I
don&#8217;t really like using Epiphany, because I want lots of Firefox
extensions that aren&#8217;t available for it. This seems like a good solution
in general, though, and it&#8217;s what I assumed would be the case in
Gobuntu; I&#8217;m slightly surprised that it wasn&#8217;t. Second, there doesn&#8217;t
seem to be an upgrade path from Feisty, the last version of Ubuntu, to
Gobuntu Gutsy. That&#8217;s really annoying. Now, possibly there is such an
upgrade path; possibly just upgrading to ordinary gutsy and then
installing the <code>gobuntu-desktop</code> package would work. However, I couldn&#8217;t
find anything, anywhere, to say that that was the case; does that
package remove all the dubiously-free stuff that Gobuntu doesn&#8217;t
contain? I don&#8217;t know. Gobuntu&#8217;s very new, so it&#8217;s entirely
understandable that there&#8217;s not a lot of documentation yet (I had to
hunt around rather a lot to find the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu">official Gobuntu page</a> so
that I could link to it!), but it was pretty disappointing that it
wasn&#8217;t clear how to install it. (I eventually decided to go with a clean
install, because then I could be sure that I wasn&#8217;t running anything
non-free, and because I wanted to take the opportunity to move to
64-bit, and because I liked the idea of being sure that I hadn&#8217;t made
configuration decisions three years ago that were adversely affecting me
now). Third, and <em>not</em> a complaint, there&#8217;s no live <span class="caps">CD</span> for Gobuntu yet.
I personally think that&#8217;s fine; again, Gobuntu&#8217;s new, and at least
initially it&#8217;s probably not destined for &#8220;ordinary&#8221; users; having people
like me use it for this release should shake any obvious bugs out of it
ready for the next release. My ideal eventual goal is that people
install Gobuntu by default, but we&#8217;re a way away from that yet. All the
hardware on my laptop that I care about works fine (the wireless card
doesn&#8217;t work, but then I wasn&#8217;t using it anyway, and the video card
doesn&#8217;t do 3d acceleration, but I can live without that for now). This
leads on partially to&#8230; Fourth, also <em>not</em> a complaint, Gobuntu allows
you to install non-free software once you have it itself installed.
There was something of a furore about this on the Gobuntu mailing list,
but I can&#8217;t think why. The distribution is, at the moment at least,
destined for people who want to ensure that they&#8217;re using entirely Free
software, and are prepared to deal with limitations (like no wireless)
to make that so. I personally am not going to install any non-free
software, even if it&#8217;s offered. The idea that Gobuntu should not allow
non-free installations from the Ubuntu archive implies that the plan is
to somehow trick people into running Gobuntu without realising it, so
that they must be forced to stay on the straight-and-narrow path of
free-software-only. I don&#8217;t need forcing; I choose it. Let&#8217;s have some
faith in people. All in all, I found it to be pretty successful. My
experience hasn&#8217;t got any worse since Feisty (and I get the advantage of
improvements made in gutsy), but now I have a warm comforting satisfied
feeling that I <em>know</em> that my machine is entirely Free. Thanks for that
warm feeling, Gobuntu and Ubuntu communities: I like&nbsp;it.</p>
