		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>On the 21st April 2007, me and 2000 other people will be in London,
doing 20 separate ten-minute demonstrations around Whitehall to protest
about the SOCPA law, which says that to demonstrate in this area you
need to beg permission from the police. I personally think that having
to ask permission to exercise your democratic right to protest is bloody
appalling, so let's try and do something about it! This is being
organised by <a href="http://www.markthomasinfo.com">Mark Thomas</a>. You can <a href="http://www.markthomasinfo.com/demo/april212007.asp">read more about the SOCPA protest
at markthomasinfo.com</a>. Basically, you have to write to Charing Cross
police station to ask for permission to demonstrate in the "SOCPA area",
so Mark's aiming for two thousand people (he's up to 1200 already!) to
each do twenty separate 10 minute one-person protests over the course of
Saturday 21st April. There are lots of buildings in the SOCPA area;
choose the ones you want to demonstrate about! Most government
ministries are there, McDonalds are there, there are supermarkets and
the Adam Smith Institute and the BBC's Millbank studios. Show people
that SOCPA is ridiculous. Thomas has produced an <a href="http://www.markthomasinfo.com/demo/demonotes.asp">info pack</a> to help
you put together what you need. In particular, <strong>you have to send a real
paper letter for each protest that you're doing to Charing Cross police
station</strong>, and they have to be in at the latest by the end of the week,
so if you want to be part of it you'll need to join in quickly. There's
a little "wizard" on Thomas's site to help you easily produce the twenty
letters you'll need! SOCPA is a stupid law. You should not have to beg
permission to protest! One woman was arrested for ringing a bell and
reading out the names of war dead, which is apparently a serious threat
to the republic in this day and age. The law was basically brought in
specifically to stop the protest by <a href="http://www.parliament-square.org.uk/about.html">Brian Haw</a>, who has been
demonstrating in Parliament Square since 2001. The government have tried
repeatedly to have him removed or deny him the right to demonstrate, and
have failed; they passed SOCPA to try and ban him and everyone else from
protesting anywhere near the government buildings, and then a court
declared that the law didn't apply to Brian because he was there before
the law came into effect! One point to Brian Haw and the courts; minus
nine million points to the government and trying to legislate away even
more of our rights. The police have said that they get about 1300 SOCPA
requests a year; we're giving them twice that in one day. Get your
placard and come with us! Here's the route that I'll be taking. If you
want to meet up while we're there, drop me a line! Among the
mini-protests that I'm doing are ones for enforcing
anti-disability-discrimination laws against websites, as is supposed to
happen, and use of open formats and open source software within the
government, which two things probably cover a good proportion of the
people reading this! 10:30 - 10:40 Parliament Square 10:50 - 11:00 DfES
