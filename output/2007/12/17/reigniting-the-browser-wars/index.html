			<p><a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=642">Alex Russell calls for a return to the browser wars</a>, citing (among
other things) the stagnancy of the W3C as a part of the problem, with
the argument that browser makers are the ones who can innovate and
they're being prevented from doing so by a slavish insistence on
"standards". Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/">Andy Clarke calls for the current W3C CSS Working Group to be immediately disbanded</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/">Opera file an antitrust complaint against Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://rudd-o.com/archives/2007/12/11/removal-of-ogg-vorbis-and-theora-from-html5-an-outrageous-disaster/">the HTML5 spec removes a recommendation for non-patent-encumbered video formats</a> after pressure from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071210-nokia-wants-w3c-to-remove-out-ogg-from-upcoming-html5-standard.html">Nokia</a>
and Apple, and all the old fights start up again. Fire and brimstone
coming down from the skies. Rivers and seas boiling. Forty years of
darkness. Earthquakes, volcanoes. The dead rising from the grave. Human
sacrifice, dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria. Alex has a
point. There is nothing but truth in the old saw that a camel is a horse
designed by committee. Evolutionary theory tells us that actual forward
progress happens faster in small communities, not in big ones. Browser
manufacturer innovation is exemplified by Microsoft creating
XMLHttpRequest, which ushered in the shiny world of Ajax; standards
committee "innovation" is exemplified by XHTML 2.0, about which no-one
gives a shit. Forward the innovation. Let the browser builders off the
leash of blind and feverish compliance with "standards" made up by
committee. However. Let us not forget that the problem with the browser
wars wasn't that it fragmented the world in lots of different
directions. The problem with the browser wars was that it fragmented the
world in lots of different directions <em>that weren't possible to
eventually implement everywhere</em>. Don't think of the output of this
"innovation" as XMLHttpRequest. Think of it as the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533754.aspx">IE filter property</a>, which is, as described on that page, "not available on the
Macintosh platform". For those of you innocent of such things, this
allows you, in Internet Explorer, to apply a visual effect to a bit of
an HTML page, where that visual effect is actually <em>implemented</em> by
DirectX, Microsoft's graphics library. Good luck porting that to Safari
if it takes off. Oh no, hang on, it's "not available on the Macintosh
platform", even in Mac IE, is it? Not that Mac IE exists any more. The
point here is very much the same as the point behind objections to DRM
technologies on music. When browser manufacturers are told "go ahead and
innovate -- we want to see progress", it's jolly difficult for them to
not think "hey, I know, why don't we take this opportunity to provide
something that we can do and other browsers can't? Then, when people
start using it, we've locked all their users into our browser!" There
are corporate executives the world over furiously masturbating
themselves into unconsciousness at the very thought of that technique
being open to them again. Perhaps you've bought a few products from
their corporations in the past. Standards bodies aren't really there to
think up ideas, although that's what they seem to have evolved into.
They're there to say, now, hang on a second, if you do that then what
about all the people with <em>no working eyes</em> / <em>some other operating
system</em> / <em>touchscreens</em> / <em>no money for patent licences</em>. They're there
to make sure that the web, which is meant to be there for everyone,
isn't separated into the haves and the have-nots, where the have-nots is
everyone who won't or can't jump on the latest bandwagon. This is
precisely why Silverlight is trying to supplant the web: to divide us
into haves and have-nots. It's why Flash is trying to supplant the web:
to divide us into haves and have-nots. It's why XUL as an
application-development language for web apps was doomed. It's possible
that the people Alex is calling on to do "innovation" in the browser
will put the best interests of the web first, and the best interests of
their companies and their browsers second. It's also possible that a
duck will fly in the window right now, juggle some lemon pies, and then
deliver IE8, but I don't think that that's very likely either. The
current mess over the proposed <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a perfect case in
point here: Nokia and Apple have refused to contemplate using the
suggested Ogg Theora video codec as a baseline format, because they fear
submarine patents despite the Theora project's assurances. OK, they may
have a point. However, the HTML5 people have stated, after this pressure
from Nokia and Apple, that "we need a codec that is known to not require
per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the open
source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be usable,
and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large
companies". It is just not possible for such a codec to exist. So, what
we, the ordinary web developers of the world, are left with is precisely
the same cluster-fuck that we currently have when publishing video: it
is <em>still</em> not possible for me to make a video and put it on the web
with some assurance that everyone can actually see the fucking thing.
How is browser vendors' "innovation" going to help with this? If they
were truly "innovative" then we'd see them trying to co-operate on
issues like this, because how can it be bad for ordinary web users and
web developers to make it easier to publish and watch video? Standards
organisations aren't there to dictate what Microsoft and Apple and
Mozilla and Opera are "allowed" to implement. They're there to provide a
voice for people who will otherwise be merrily buttfucked and then
thrown over the side in the pursuit of "innovation". Think Web Standards
Project rather than W3C. Of course, the WaSP seems to have lost its way
and its voice a bit recently; are they coming back? It's easy to just
say "no, no, no" to new ideas, but it's equally easy to say, well, I'm
alright, Jack, if you're not coming along with us then you'll just get
left behind, regardless of whether you're not coming along because
you're unable to. If you think that Apple were right to resist video
formats, ask yourself if you'd have been happy if the HTML5 spec had
suggested Windows Media format as the default. If you think that browser
vendors should innovate, ask yourself how happy you'd be implementing
DirectX on a Macintosh. Fix things, yeah. Put some innovation back in,
yeah. Let's, though, try to not throw out the baby along with the
bathwater.</p>
