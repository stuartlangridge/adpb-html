		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m in the market for a new mobile phone. My SonyEricsson z800i (chosen
after <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/11/17/i-need-a-new-phone">lots of helpful advice</a> from my glorious readship) is now
starting to feel the pinch a bit: the buttons sometimes don&#8217;t respond,
for example. It&#8217;s also the size of Bolivia, which means that if I&#8217;m not
wearing a jacket and I try and cram it into my pocket then I look like
John Wayne. Plus, people laugh at me on the train because they think I&#8217;m
doing a Gordon Gekko impression and it&#8217;s some sort of performance art.
So, new phone required. I do have a list of requirements, which you&#8217;ll
find below because I&#8217;m now looking for advice again, but I thought this
time I had it cracked. After research (by which I obviously mean:
reading things on the internet), I decided on the Motorola <span class="caps">KRZR</span> K1
(which is sometimes called a <span class="caps">MOTOKRZR</span> instead. why? Who the fuck knows.
Perhaps they&#8217;re twins.) It&#8217;s a nice looking phone, and it did pretty
much all the stuff I wanted it to do. Including (and this is important
for the next bit), SyncML, the thing that lets you synchronise your list
of contacts with a server out there on the wild wild internet. I need
that: for one thing, I don&#8217;t want to have to type all the people I know
in again. For another, I like a backup. Thirdly, it means I can edit
contact details on the web rather than on the phone. I already have a
SyncML account at mobical.net, which is excellent; I don&#8217;t want to move
to another one. (People thinking &#8220;just store your contacts on the <span class="caps">SIM</span>
card&#8221;: that fails the &#8220;have a backup&#8221; criterion.) I noticed that
Vodafone (my current mobile provider) offer the <span class="caps">KRZR</span> in their list of
&#8220;phones you can upgrade to&#8221;, and after a phone call it turned out that I
could upgrade to that phone for <strong>free</strong>. How cool is that, eh? That
sounds like the way for me. Yes, says I; I&#8217;ll have that, please.
<strong>Vodafone person:</strong> &#8220;It comes in two colours, sir, blue and silver.
Which would you like?&#8221; <strong>Your gentle narrator:</strong> &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference
between them?&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;Nothing; one&#8217;s blue and one&#8217;s silver.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong>
&#8220;<span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;ll have a blue one, please. I like blue.&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;Certainly, sir,
it&#8217;ll be with you tomorrow by courier.&#8221; The next day (Friday 16th March,
last Friday) my brand new phone arrives. I excitedly unpack the box, put
the battery and the microSD card and my <span class="caps">SIM</span> card in it, plug it in to
charge up. Two hours pass, and it&#8217;s completely charged. Ringing my phone
number rings the phone &#8212; yay! So, excitement building, I think: <span class="caps">OK</span>,
time to pull down my contacts onto this phone. I <span class="caps">RTFM</span> (rly!) &#8212; the
<em>Vodafone-branded</em> manual, note &#8212; to discover that the way you set up a
SyncML connection is:
<code>Menu &gt; Connectivity &gt; Synchronisation &gt; Vodafone sync &gt; New Entry</code>. Ah,
but&#8230;in <code>Synchronisation</code>, there&#8217;s no <code>Vodafone sync</code> entry. There&#8217;s
just <code>Exchange</code>, and that&#8217;s it. After a few minutes poking around, I
ring 191 to talk to Vodafone about it. After explaining my problem, and
then explaining it again in shorter words, and then explaining it again
to a technical person, and <em>then</em> explaining that I was following the
instructions in their manual with their logo on the front, I get: <strong>V:</strong>
&#8220;Ah, the blue <span class="caps">KRZR</span> doesn&#8217;t have that function. You need the silver one
for that.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong> (splutter) &#8220;But I spoke to your colleague who said
that they were the same!&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, she must have got that
wrong. The silver one supports SyncML and the blue one doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong>
&#8220;But the phone itself supports it. You mean that you&#8217;ve deliberately
<em>disabled</em> the function in the blue KRZRs?&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;Yep.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong> &#8220;The
silver one definitely does it?&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;Definitely.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong> &#8220;<span class="caps">OK</span>. You&#8217;ll
send me a silver one and pick up this blue one at your expense, since
you lied to me about them being the same.&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> (concilatory tone) &#8220;Of
course, sir, no problem. It&#8217;ll be there Monday. At some point between
8.30 and 6pm.&#8221; A little divergence here. How the fuck is it reasonable
to say &#8220;We&#8217;ll deliver it at some point in this <span class="caps">NINE</span> <span class="caps">HOUR</span> <span class="caps">WINDOW</span>&#8221;??? It
was fortunate I could have this delivered to work. Everyone does this
now. I end up having to take a whole damned day off when we have
furniture delivered, and 90% of that time off is wasted for the half an
hour that they actually deliver the bastard. While I appreciate that
it&#8217;s a different situation, Andy tells me that a drayman, delivering
beer to pubs, can give you a <span class="caps">FIVE</span> <span class="caps">MINUTE</span> window in which they&#8217;ll turn
up, and they always manage it. Moving furniture is a bit different to
moving beer, especially since beer deliveries are always to the same
pubs rather than arbitrary houses, but it&#8217;s just one more example of
companies making customers bear all the brunt and pain even though
they&#8217;re paying the money. Fuckers. Back to the story. You can see where
this is leading, can&#8217;t you? Monday passes: no phone. Today, Tuesday: the
new phone arrives. A silver <span class="caps">KRZR</span> K1. Unpack, put in <span class="caps">SIM</span>, put in microSD,
put in battery, charge, two hours, turn on, ring to confirm it works,
decide to check SyncML. (are you ready? prepare yourselves&#8230;you might
want to hold on to something so you can properly handle the shock) Lo
and behold, my snazzy new silver <span class="caps">KRZR</span>, which definitely, definitely
supports SyncML, has exactly the same damned Exchange item and nothing
else in its Synchronisation menu! Amazing, eh? fume, fume, fume, fume.
191. Wait for two minutes. <strong>Me:</strong> (five minutes of introductory stuff
elided) &#8220;You swore blind that this phone wasn&#8217;t hobbled like the blue
one! grnch grnch grnch&#8221; (time passes. I try to not get too irate because
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/20/unfairness">it&#8217;s not the fault of the call centre employee</a>) <strong>V:</strong> I&#8217;ve spoken
to our technical people, and they say that the phone supports SyncML.&#8221;
<strong>Me:</strong> &#8220;I <strong>know</strong> it supports SyncML! You numpties have deliberately
turned it off in the Vodafone firmware! Which you swore blind you hadn&#8217;t
done on the silver one! grnch grnch grnch&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to talk
to our 14-day returns department.&#8221; (time passes. You may be eaten by a
grue. Alternatively you may lose so much blood by bleeding out of your
ears in anger that you fall unconscious.) <strong>Different Vodafone person:</strong>
&#8220;No, sir, the blue and the silver phones are exactly the same, they&#8217;re
just different colours.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong> &#8220;But, but, but, I specifically asked
that and was told it was not the case! I&#8217;ve wasted nearly a week of my
life on this!&#8221; <strong>V:</strong> &#8220;All we can recommend is that you send the phone
back. We&#8217;ll cancel your 18 month contract extension when we get the
phone back.&#8221; <strong>Me:</strong> &#8220;And I shall go and talk to a third -party phone
vendor who doesn&#8217;t hobble their phones. Why do you do that, by the way?&#8221;
<strong>V:</strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir.&#8221; So, the phone goes back tomorrow. Remember,
kids: winners don&#8217;t buy phones from Vodafone, because they&#8217;ll tell you
lies about their capabilities. Their network seems fine, and their
technical people seem fine if you can get to them, but their phone sales
people just <em>lie</em> to you. Now I need a phone. I&#8217;m still debating the
<span class="caps">KRZR</span>, but from a third-party. If you have any other suggestions that
will meet the stuff below, I&#8217;m interested in hearing&nbsp;them.</p>
<ul>
<li>A flip phone. Not a clamshell one (which is short and rounded and
    quite thick), but a long thin one (like the <span class="caps">KRZR</span>, or the&nbsp;z800i)</li>
<li>Not made by Sony. I&#8217;m boycotting Sony for putting a rootkit on
    people&#8217;s machines and lying about it. Not interested in discussion
    on this point: I&#8217;m not asking <em>you</em> to boycott them, but I am&nbsp;doing.</li>
<li>Supports&nbsp;SyncML</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li>Enough Java support to run Opera&nbsp;Mini</li>
</ul>
<p>For extra credit (read: I&#8217;d really like these things, but they aren&#8217;t&nbsp;ultra-critical)</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports <span class="caps">JSR</span>-75, which means that Java applets can read and write to
    the phone&#8217;s storage (<span class="caps">SD</span> card). This will be immeasurably helpful for
    ReadManiac, the e-book reader that I&nbsp;use.</li>
<li>Charges over <span class="caps">USB</span> instead of a proprietary&nbsp;connector</li>
<li>Can be plugged into a <span class="caps">USB</span> socket and appear as a hard&nbsp;drive</li>
<li>Plays mp3s. For über-extra-credit: plays Ogg&nbsp;Vorbis.</li>
<li>I can buy it with a Vodafone contract, so I don&#8217;t have weeks of pain
    transferring my number and getting a data account set up. If I
    can&#8217;t, then it can be on any network except T-Mobile, who have
    ruinously high data&nbsp;charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions welcome. Remember: Vodafone tell you lies about phones.
Watch out for&nbsp;them.</p>
