		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Two years after I first laid out <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/11/13/downloading-music">my plea to be able to download music
the way I wanted</a>, Amazon have pretty much come through. My canonical
test song whenever someone announces a new music service is "Feelin'
Good" by Nina Simone, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good/dp/B000VZDZBU/">here it is on Amazon.com</a>. So, let's test
this service against <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/11/13/downloading-music">my list of requirements</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can download one track, instead of a whole album; I don’t want ten
    Nina Simone songs, I just want the one I’m looking for - <strong>PASS</strong></li>
<li>No DRM. None. I don’t mind what the format is, if there’s no DRM, as
    long as it can be played on Linux (which is pretty much everything).
    Bonus points for oggs. Half a bonus point for just plain mp3. -
    <strong>PASS</strong></li>
<li>A track costs a pound or less. I’m not paying more than a quid for
    one song. - <strong>PASS</strong> (99c is about 50p)</li>
<li>I feel comfortable putting my credit card number into the site. This
    means, in practice, that if it’s called something like
    mp3downloads.haxx0r.ru, I am not interested. - <strong>PASS</strong></li>
<li>I can just buy a song by putting my credit card number in and
    getting it for download. I don’t need to sign up for an account,
    give them all my details, none of that. - <strong>FAIL</strong></li>
<li>My music tastes aren’t very eclectic, so I’d expect the service to
    carry most of what I’d want to listen to. This means that a service
    for one label alone isn’t really what I want. I don’t want to
    discover new music with this; I want to get the stuff I already know
    about and want to listen to. - <strong>PASS</strong></li>
<li>I’ll get, probably, about five songs a year. So a subscription
    service is out, especially since with most of them your music stops
    working when you unsubscribe. - <strong>PASS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So it only fails on one thing: you need to sign up for an account.
However, I already <em>have</em> an Amazon account. This is still technically a
failure -- because my desire for no signup was not only for my own
benefit but because I didn't want it to be a powerplay by some firm who
would then spam everyone who bought mp3s until the end of time -- but
largely people already have Amazon accounts and Amazon have shown
themselves (in my experience) to be reasonable citizens in this regard.
I don't receive lots of spam or unsolicited "recommendations" from them,
and (from a web, if not open source perspective) I think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">Amazon Web
Services</a> are a Good Thing. So although that's a fail I'm prepared to
let it slide. Well done Amazon, I say. I suspect that it's only tracks
from some record companies, or some labels, or some other criterion that
I don't care about, but since my test track appears there they must have
at least <em>some</em> of the music I like. Now I get to start buying mp3s.
<strong>Update</strong>: dammit, it requires a US billing address. Obviously I could
lie about that, but if I was happy to lie then I'd just google for the
mp3. So it's presumably US-only at this point. Anyone got any contacts
at Amazon who could give me an indication as to when or whether it's
being rolled out to other countries?</p>
