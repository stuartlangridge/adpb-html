			<p>Stone me I'm busy. Bah. Haven't even had time to write some things up
here. However, my collection of kept-unread things in Google Reader has
reached high enough proportions that I have to do something about it, so
this gets a few things off my list. A post about the stuff I discussed
at LugRadio Live -- whether it might be reasonable to make "be
permissive about IP" be the default for Linux distributions and make the
Americans and others in oppressive IP regimes do the legwork to <em>remove</em>
what they consider to be "patent-infringing", rather than all of us
non-Americans suffering for it -- is stacked into the holding pattern
and circulating over Heathrow, incidentally.  </p>
<h4>Recent interesting things</h4>

<dt>Thank god for that. Finally. <em>Finally</em>.</dt>
<dt><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/248227/">ATI open graphics specs and open source the driver for video cards</a></dt>
<dd>This is a pretty big deal, this one. At first blush it looks as if
two of the three leading graphics card manufacturers (ATI and
Intel)<span style="color:red" title="Intel aren't leading in performance but they are in installed base">*</span>
will now have good support in open source. I imagine someone at
nVidia has at least noticed that this has happened. More openness of
this sort cannot be a bad thing. Well done ATI, I say.</dd>
<dd>I should note a couple of small reservations: it's only for their
newer cards (i.e., not most of the ATI cards that are out there),
and it's not as simple as them just open sourcing their existing
fglrx binary driver. They're providing a library to access the BIOS
on the card, but most importantly they're providing
<strong>specifications</strong> for the cards. It's still down to the open source
community to write the driver itself, but we've historically not had
a problem with that (and ATI are <em>funding</em> the initial writing of
this driver!). <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=826&amp;num=1">Phoronix has more detail on what ATI are actually
doing</a> -- the important quotation is "The aim of this open-source
driver is not to overtake the fglrx driver but rather is designed
for those who just want a working desktop with 3D capabilities and
basic video playback. This new driver is ideal for FOSS enthusiasts"
-- the point here is that if you want the very best performance from
your ATI card you'll still need to go proprietary, but there's now
enough information that the open source code will be able to provide
the things that a lot of people are clamouring for -- 3d
acceleration, video acceleration, 3d desktop effects. Well done,
ATI, I say. Obviously I'd like to see it all being Free, but I'm
confident in the open source community's ability to build a great
driver (maybe even a better driver than the binary one?) based on
having the information they've asked for, and now they've got it.

<dt><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax 2007</a></dt>
<dd>I'm really looking forward to speaking at @media Ajax this year. The
list of speakers is pretty cool, indeed, including some people I've
never had the chance to meet. As usual, details of events I'm going
to be at are on my <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/events/">events page</a>.</dd>
<dt>Separated at birth</dt>
<dd>John "jQuery" Resig <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2007/08/21/speaking-at-media-ajax#comment-99501">says</a> that he's "baffled" by why I referred
to him as John "Kelly Osbourne" Resig in an earlier post. Well, the
camera doesn't lie.</dd>

On the other hand, John did an excellent <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/building-a-javascript-library/">Google Tech Talk on
building a JavaScript library</a>, so don't hold it against him.</p>

<dd>Useful, although convoluted. Parallels lets Mac people virtualise
from a bootable partition, so you can either boot into your image or
run it as a VM inside another OS. Can we do that under Linux? It'd
save my dad rebooting into Windows to make his scanner work.</dd>
