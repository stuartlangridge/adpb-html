			<p>I was starting to worry a bit about Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth --
my fears that Ubuntu was becoming just a little bit more non-free every
day, that they weren't really pursuing the goals that I'd like to see
them pursue. Obviously, they aren't obliged to do what I say -- I
suspect that Shuttleworth's opinion would be that I am welcome to make
myself eight hundred million dollars and start my own Linux distribution
if I don't like the way he does it -- but I'm deeply, deeply pleased to
see that I was wrong all along. First, there's <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/130">Gobuntu</a>, the promised
totally-free version of Ubuntu, as part of the next Ubuntu release.
(I've already tried a nightly, and, er, <code>tasksel</code> failed during the
installer. I'd file a bug but I'm not sure where to put it; there seems
to be no Gobuntu product in Launchpad.) Fantastic news; I'll leave it a
little while to stabilise and then try it (or I'll try it very soon if
someone can tell me where I should send bug reports). It's Guadec this
week, so I can't afford to sod up my (working, free-drivers only) laptop
before I do my talk, but I want to help with Gobuntu. Second, Mark's
also flagged the idea of <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/131">being able to buy a laptop filled with free-software-supported hardware</a>. Those of you who listen to LugRadio
will know that I've whittled on repeatedly about how people don't want
to install Linux, they want to just buy a computer that works. It'd be
so good if I could just go and buy a laptop that works, the next time I
need a laptop, something which supports all the cool stuff that the free
desktop can do. I'm pretty tired of people saying "I don't like Linux,
my OS X just works", when half the problem there is that if I tried to
install OS X on some random arbitrary computer it wouldn't have any
drivers there <em>either</em>. Having "Linux-specific" laptops isn't by any
means the only approach we should take, but if they existed it'd be such
a good way to get things out to people -- someone says "I'd like to try
Linux, I've booted it a bit and it seems good and I want to buy a
machine" and I point them at this. Greatness. I've signed up to the
mailing list; hope there's some discussion there soon. In brief, then:
sorry for doubting you, Mark. Those of you reading who are busy
preparing the word "fanboy" in a retort -- yeah, I am a fan, a fan who's
just had his faith renewed. Now, when can I buy an OpenMoko phone that
seamlessly integrates perfectly with my Ubuntu desktop?</p>
