		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Well, we had the two days. LugRadio Live 2007 happened last weekend, and
it was super-duper-superb, yes indeed. There are lots of <a href="http://technorati.com/posts/tag/lugradio+live">reports you
can read</a> about what it was like (including one chap who didn&#8217;t like
the show at all and called it <a href="http://blog.yibble.org/2007/07/08/lugradio-live-2/">an endless stream of sub-par nob-gags</a>,
which will be appearing on t-shirts in due course). My personal
favourite bit, I think, was Adam walking out with his hooded robe to the
Rocky music, but the whole thing was just unutterably great. If you want
to see more of Adam, and you&#8217;re aware of <strong>meatspin.com</strong>, then you
might like <a href="http://lugradio.org/sweetspin">lugradio.org/sweetspin</a> (really, really, really <span class="caps">NSFW</span>,
though). Now it&#8217;s all over, I&#8217;d like to say thanks to people! Firstly,
thanks to our&nbsp;crew.</p>
<p><img alt="All the crew in one place" src="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photos/20070708-lugradio/dscf4547.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="http://schwuk.com/articles/2007/7/12/sworn-in-the-usa">All the crew in one&nbsp;place</a></p>
<p>They did a magnificent job. There&#8217;s no way we could have got everything
done without them. If you want to know how much work they did, take a
look at Xalior&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd0mjVydYsU">timelapse video</a> of the first day. Special thanks to
Chris Procter and Dave Morley for being crew heads, Kat for making
cakes, Ron&#8217;s wife for the morning bacon sandwiches, Ron for taking
millions of photos (which will be available soon), and Rev. Tig for
being the audio flunky and putting up with all Jono&#8217;s shit on the second
day. You&#8217;re all heroes. Speaking of videos, a special thanks to Tony
Whitmore and his video crew, who recorded a great deal of the event.
We&#8217;re hoping to have videos available shortly of the talks &#8212; yes, I
know we always say this, but this year we let Tony deal with it instead
of us and so it might actually happen! Next, I want to say thankyou to
the people who gave us money and things. That&#8217;s everyone coming in the
door, of course, but also Bytemark Hosting, Sun, Google, O&#8217;Reilly, Red
Hat, Yahoo, and Canonical. Bytemark and Sun and Google gave us the money
we needed to put the event on, O&#8217;Reilly gave us lanyards and books to
give as prizes, and everyone gave us stuff to go in the goodie bags
(which were charmingly named the Lugradio Live&nbsp;Nutsacks).</p>
<p><img alt="Ade in RH" src="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photos/20070707-lugradio/dscf3200.jpg" /></p>
<p>Ade was particularly pleased with the Red Hat stuff, shameless Fedora whore that he&nbsp;is</p>
<p>Next, the speakers. They all did a great job, some travelling from
hugely far afield (America, Indonesia, across Europe), and people seem
to have enjoyed the talks they went to. Special mention goes to Ted
Haaeeeaaeaeeeeagaeeaer for using every swear-word he could think of now
that he doesn&#8217;t work for Novell any more, Bruno and MrBen for the Great
LugRadio Quiz, Steve Lamb, Chris diBona, and Becky Hogge from the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2007/07/09/org-at-lugradio-live-2007/">Open
Rights Group</a> for what I thought was the most interesting talk of the
day. Des Burley from my law firm, Mills and Reeve, gets an extra mention
for not only doing a talk but ably coping with me putting him on the
spot by asking questions about patents during LugRadio Live and
Unleashed. Extra-special bonus thanks go to a chap called Chris Hallam
(or something similar), who&#8217;s responsible for the <span class="caps">BBC</span> iPlayer, and who I
pulled up on stage with no preparation to receive a booting from Becky
and the audience about the iPlayer only working on Windows. Chris, I
don&#8217;t know how your last name is spelled and so I&#8217;m having difficulty
getting hold of you to say thankyou: if you read this, or if anyone
reads this who knows who Chris is, can they <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/contact">contact me</a>?</p>
<p><img alt="Chris and Becky on stage" src="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photos/20070708-lugradio/dscf4201.jpg" /></p>
<p>Chris and Becky on&nbsp;stage</p>
<p>Our exhibitors come next, and I want to say thanks to them too. The
exhibition this year was a little smaller than last year, and a couple
of people have said it was rather noisy for the talks (or that the talks
were rather noisy for the exhibition!) &#8212; this year we put the
exhibition in the same room as the atrium stage precisely because
exhibitors complained last year that they were stuck off in a room on
their own and it was boring. So&#8230;not sure what to do, there.
Suggestions invited. Special thanks go to the exhibitors who came
through when I walked around the expo at the end and hassled them for
prizes that we could give away from the stage, particularly Josette from
O&#8217;Reilly for giving us loads of t-shirts, Jon and the gang from Red Hat
for giving us a shitload of stuff, and the <span class="caps">GP2X</span> people for giving us a
<span class="caps">GP2X</span> to give away! Wish I&#8217;d got it. Of course, we ended up giving the
<span class="caps">GP2X</span> for the best LugRadio story to a woman who suggested that I should
look like someone from Shaun of the Dead, for which she gets all of my
no love. Hmph. Extra special thanks to John Leach, who designed all of
our t-shirts (the special ones for the four large gents and the crew
t-shirts), despite the crippling burden of his ridiculous new afro&nbsp;haircut.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/willcooke/761233500/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1231/761233500_9af8800389_m_d.jpg" alt="boogie"></a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t blame it on sunshine, don&#8217;t blame it on moonlight, don&#8217;t blame it on the good
times, blame it on the&nbsp;boogie</p>
<p>Finally, there were two pieces of news that we announced at the end of
LugRadio Live and Unleashed. The first, the bad news, is that Ade&#8217;s
decided to leave the show. No more bald man. We tried to talk him out of
it, but apparently he wants to spend more time with his razor or
something. Ade, here&#8217;s the bit where I say: thanks for everything over
the last few years. The show won&#8217;t be the same without you, it really
won&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll miss ya, especially when it comes time to look into Ade&#8217;s
Crystal Bald to see what&#8217;s coming up for the next year in Linux and we
don&#8217;t have it any more. However, Chris Procter, who&#8217;s been a stand-in
presenter on the show before, is bravely stepping into the void left by
El Baldo de Maximo. Chris has the same sysadmin leanings as Ade
(although more hair, but not by much), and I&#8217;m really looking forward to
the next season &#8212; as you know, Adam has also recently replaced Matt, so
there could be an entirely new vibe for the new season! Goodbye to Ade,
and hello to Chris: season 5 of LugRadio will rock harder than anything
ever has. Chris will be part of the show during this coming week, when
we&#8217;ll be recording a series of special shows at Guadec, the Gnome User
and Developer Conference in Birmingham. Look out for&nbsp;them!</p>
<p><img alt="Chris" src="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photos/20070707-lugradio/dscf3253.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Lord of the Rings, as Chris is affectionately&nbsp;known</p>
<p>The second piece of news
is, after much questioning and requests, LugRadio is coming to America!
Yes, yes indeed, LugRadio Live <span class="caps">USA</span> will be happening in the San
Francisco Bay Area in March 2008! More details as we have
them; we&#8217;ll be putting up a site soon where you can see what&#8217;s going on
and buy tickets. Big thanks to Google for making this possible. We&#8217;ve
talked a lot about how we wanted LugRadio Live <span class="caps">USA</span> to have the same
feel, the same vibe about it that <span class="caps">LRL</span> has here, and we&#8217;ve been convinced
that that&#8217;s possible. So, we&#8217;re coming to the land of the free. Prepare
yourselves. Next year there will be two LugRadio Lives. I can&#8217;t&nbsp;wait.</p>
