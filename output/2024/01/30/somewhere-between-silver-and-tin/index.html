		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>There’s a YouTube channel called 
<a href="https://youtube.com/@Clickspring">Clickspring</a>, 
run by an Australian bloke called Chris 
who is a machinist: a mechanical engineer 
with a lathe and a mill and all manner of 
little tools. I am not a machinist — at 
school I was fairly inept at what we 
called CDT, for Craft Design and 
Technology, and what Americans much more 
prosaically call “shop class”. My dad was, 
though, or an engineer at least. Although 
Chris builds clocks and beautiful brass 
mechanisms, and my dad built aeroplanes. 
Heavy engineering. All my engineering is 
software, which actual engineers don’t 
think is engineering at all, and most of 
the time I don’t either. </p>
<p>You can 
romanticise it: claim that software 
development isn’t craft, it’s <em>art</em>. And 
there is a measure of truth in this. It’s 
like writing, which is the other thing I 
spend a lot of time doing for money; 
that’s an art, too. </p>
<p>If you’re doing it 
right, at least. </p>
<p>Most of the writing 
that’s done, though, isn’t art. And most 
of the software development isn’t, either. 
Or most of the engineering. For every one 
person creating beauty in prose or code or 
steel, there are fifty just there doing 
the job with no emotional investment in 
what they’re doing at all. Honestly, 
that’s probably a good thing, and not a 
complaint. While I might like the 
theoretical idea of a world where 
everything is hand made by someone who 
cares, I don’t think that you should have 
to care in order to get paid. The people 
who are paying you don’t care, so you 
shouldn’t have to either. </p>
<p>It’s nice if you 
can swing it so you get both, though. </p>
<p>The 
problem is that it’s not possible to 
instruct someone to give a damn. You can’t 
regulate the UK government into giving a 
damn about people who fled a war to come 
here to find their dream of being a nurse, 
you can’t regulate Apple bosses into 
giving a damn about the open web, you 
can’t regulate CEOs into giving a damn 
about their employees or governments about 
their citizens or landlords about their 
tenants. That’s not what regulation is 
for; people who give a damn largely don’t 
need regulation because they want to do 
the right thing. They might need a little 
steering into knowing what the right thing 
is, but that’s not the same. </p>
<p>No, 
regulation is there as a reluctant 
compromise: since you can’t make people 
care, the best you can do is in some rough 
and ready fashion make them behave in a 
similar way to the way they would if they 
did. Of course, this is why the most 
insidious kind of response is not an 
attempt to evade responsibility but an attack on 
the system of regulation itself. Call 
judges saboteurs or protesters criminals 
or insurgents patriots. And why the most 
heinous betrayal is one done in the name 
of the very thing you’re destroying. Claim 
to represent the will of the people while 
hurting those people. Claim to be 
defending the law while hiding violence 
and murder behind a badge. Claim privacy 
as a shield for surveillance or for 
exclusion. <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/">We all sorta 
thought</a> 
that the system could protect us, that 
those with the power could be trusted to 
use it at least a little responsibly.  And 
the last year has been one more in a 
succession of years demonstrating just how 
wrong that is. This and no other is the 
root from which a tyrant springs; when he 
first appears he is a protector. </p>
<p>The worst 
thing about it is that the urge to protect 
other people is not only real but the best 
thing about ourselves. When it’s actually 
real. Look after others, especially those 
who need it, and look after yourself, 
because you’re one of the people who needs 
it. </p>
<p>Chris from Clickspring polishes things 
to a high shine using tin, which surprised 
me. I thought bringing out the beauty in 
something needed a soft cloth but no, it’s 
done with metal. Some things, like silver, 
are basically shiny with almost no effort; 
there’s a reason people have prized silver 
things since before we could even write 
down why, and it’s not just because you 
could find lumps of it lying around the 
place with no need to build a smelting 
furnace. Silver looks good, and makes you 
look good in turn. Tin is useful, and it 
helps polish other things to a high shine. </p>
<p>Today’s my 48th 
<a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2023/01/30/ronin/">birthday</a>. 
A highly composite number. The ways Torah 
wisdom is acquired. And somewhere between 
silver and tin. That sounds OK to me.</p>
