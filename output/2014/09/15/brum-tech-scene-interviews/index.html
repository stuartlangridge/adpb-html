		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Today I released the first of the <a href="http://www.brumtechscene.co.uk">Brum Tech Scene interviews</a>, with me talking to <a href="http://sjenner.co.uk">Simon Jenner</a> of <a href="http://siliconcanal.co.uk">Silicon Canal</a> and Oxygen Startups. There&#8217;s a video on the site from me explaining why I&#8217;m doing this, but I figure that the more discerning audience for <em>as days pass by</em> might appreciate a more in-depth&nbsp;discussion. </p>
<p>I love this city. I love that we&#8217;re prepared to spend a hundred and ninety million quid on building the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2013/09/07/the-superb-palace-of-bookland-or-the-library-of-birmingham/">best library in the whole world</a>. I love that there&#8217;s so much going on, tech-wise. But nobody talks to anybody else. If you look at, say, Brighton, the whole tech scene there all hang out together. They can put on a Digital Brighton week and have dConstruct be part of it and Seb do mad things with visualisations and that&#8217;s marvellous. We ought to have that. I want us to have&nbsp;that. </p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have a tech scene. We&#8217;ve got twenty separate tech scenes. What I want to do is knock down the walls a bit. So the designers talk to the <span class="caps">SEO</span> people and the Linux geeks talk to the designers. Because there is no way that this can be a bad&nbsp;thing. </p>
<p>I also want to learn a bit about videos. Now, let&#8217;s be clear here. I know from a decade of podcasting that with a mild expenditure of money on gear, and a great sound engineer (Jono Bacon, step forward) you can produce something as good as the professionals. <a href="http://badvoltage.org">Bad Voltage</a> sounds as good, production-wise, as the <span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8217;s Today programme does. Video is not like that. There is a substantial difference between amateur and professional efforts; one bloke using mobile phones to record cannot make something that looks like Sherlock or Game of Thrones. I&#8217;m not trying to look professional here; I&#8217;m aiming for &#8220;competent amateur&#8221;. I&#8217;ve learned loads about how to record a video interview, how to mix it, how to do the editing. Sit far enough apart that your voice doesn&#8217;t sound on their mic. Apply video effects to the clip <em>before</em> you cut it up. Don&#8217;t speak over the interviewee. KDEnLive&#8217;s &#8220;set audio reference&#8221; is witchcraft brilliance. I knew none of this two months ago. And I&#8217;ve really enjoyed learning. I am in no wise <em>good</em> at this stuff, but I&#8217;m better than I&nbsp;was. </p>
<p>This has been a fun project to set up, and it will continue being fun as I record more interviews. My plan is to have a new one every Monday morning, indefinitely, as long as people like them and I&#8217;m still interested in doing them. I should give big love to Mike, my designer, who I fought with tooth and nail about the site design and the desaturated blue look to the videos, and to Dan Newns who sat and was interviewed as a test when I first came up with this idea, and has provided invaluable feedback&nbsp;throughout. </p>
<p>If you know something about video editing, I&#8217;d love to hear how I can do better. Ping <a href="http://twitter.com/sil">me on twitter</a> or <a href="http://kryogenix.org/contact">by mail</a>. Tell me as well who you want to hear interviewed; which cool projects are going on that I don&#8217;t know about. I&#8217;d also love to hear about cool venues in the city in which I can do interviews; one of my subsidiary goals here is to show off the city&#8217;s tech places. Annoyingly, I spoke to the Library and to the Birmingham Museums Trust and they were all &#8220;fill out our fifteen page form&#8221; because they&#8217;re oriented around the <span class="caps">BBC</span> coming in with a crew of twenty camera people, not one ginger guy with a mobile phone and a dream. Maybe I&#8217;ll do things with <a href="http://twitter.com/HubBirmingham">@HubBirmingham</a> once they actually&nbsp;exist. </p>
<p>I should talk about the tech, here. I record the interviews on an iPhone 5, a Nexus 4, and a little <span class="caps">HD</span> camera I bought years ago. The audio is done with two Røde Smartlav lapel mics plugged into the two phones. None of this is expensive, which has a cost in terms of video and audio quality but critically <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have much of a cost in terms of actual pounds sterling. And editing is done with KDEnLive (kdenlive?) which is a really powerful non-linear video editor for Ubuntu, and the team who make it should be quite proud. The big thing I&#8217;m missing (apart from a cameraman) is a tripod, which I can probably buy for about ten quid, and I will do once I find one that&#8217;s tall and yet still fits in my laptop&nbsp;bag. </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s the story of the Brum Tech Scene interviews. There&#8217;ll be one every Monday. I hope you like them. I hope they help, even in a small way, to make the Brum tech scene gel together even more than it has thus far. Let me know what you think. <a href="http://www.brumtechscene.co.uk">brumtechscene.co.uk</a>. </p>
