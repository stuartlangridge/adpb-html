		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>When you talk about the &#8220;user experience&#8221; of the thing you&#8217;re building, remember that developers who use your APIs are users too. And you need to think about their&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>We seem to have created a world centred on github where everyone has to manage dependencies by hand, like we had to in 1997. This problem was completely solved by <code>apt</code> twenty years ago, but the new cool github world is, it seems, too cool to care about that. Go off to get some new project by <code>git clone</code>ing it and it&#8217;s quite likely to say &#8220;oh, and it depends on $SOME_OTHER_PROJECT (here&#8217;s a link to that project&#8217;s github repo)&#8221;. And then you have to go fetch both and set them up yourself. Which is really&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<p>Now, there are good reasons why to not care about existing dependency package management systems such as <code>apt</code>. Getting stuff into Ubuntu is hard, laborious work and most projects don&#8217;t want to do it. PPAs make it easier, but not much easier; if you&#8217;re building a thing and not specifically targeting Ubuntu with it, you don&#8217;t want to have to learn about Launchpad and PPAs and build recipes and whatnot. This sort of problem is also solves neatly <em>for packages in a specific language</em> by that language&#8217;s own packaging system; Python stuff is installable with <code>pip install whatever</code> and a virtualenv; Node stuff is installable with <code>npm install whatever</code>; all these take care of fetching any dependent stuff. But this rush for each language to have its own &#8220;app store&#8221; for its apps and libraries means that combining things from <em>different</em> languages is still the same 20th century nightmare. Take, for example, Mozilla&#8217;s new <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/firefox-tools-adapter/">Firefox Tools Adaptor</a>. I&#8217;m not picking on Mozilla here; the <span class="caps">FTA</span> is new, and it&#8217;s pretty cool, and it&#8217;s not finished yet. This is just the latest in a long line of things which exhibit the problem. The <span class="caps">FTA</span> allows you to use the Firefox devtools to debug web things running in other browsers. Including, excitingly, debugging things running in iOS Safari on the iPhone. Now, doing that&#8217;s a pain in the ringpiece at the moment; you have to install Google&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy"><code>ios-webkit-debug-proxy</code></a>, which needs to be compiled, and Apple break compatibility with it all the time and so you have to fetch and build new versions of <code>libimobiledevice</code> or something. I was eager to see that the new Firefox Tools Adaptor promises to allow debugging on iOS Safari just by installing a Firefox&nbsp;extension. </p>
<p>And then I read about it, and it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_Tools_Adapter">says</a>, &#8220;The Adapter&#8217;s iOS support uses Google&#8217;s ios-webkit-debug-proxy. Until that support is built directly into the add-on, you&#8217;ll need to install and run the <code>ios-webkit-debug-proxy</code> binary yourself&#8221;. Sigh. That&#8217;s the hard part. And it&#8217;s not any easier&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m not blaming Mozilla here &#8212; they plan to fix this, but they&#8217;ll have to fix it by essentially bundling <code>ios-webkit-debug-proxy</code> <em>with</em> the <span class="caps">FTA</span>. That&#8217;ll work, and that&#8217;s an important thing for them to do in order to provide a slick user experience for developers using this tool (because &#8220;download and compile this other thing first&#8221; is not ever ever a nice user&nbsp;experience). </p>
<p>It is made worse by people using a language packaging system (designed for people developing libraries for a given language) to do app distribution. See, for example, <a href="http://tmux.me/">tmuxme</a>, which is an app for sharing a terminal session with many people (think of it like screen sharing, but for a terminal). And how do you install it? <code>gem install tmuxme</code>. No. Ruby&#8217;s <code>gem</code> command is for developers to download a Ruby <em>library</em> that their Ruby package needs. I, as someone who wants to use this tool, should not have to care that it&#8217;s written in Ruby. I should not have to have a Ruby development environment set up in order to use an app. See <a href="https://talk.birmingham.io/t/can-anyone-help-sil-with-his-ruby-issues/275">the birmingham.io forum thread</a> for much much more about this, and why it <em>doesn&#8217;t even work</em>. New rather cool app <a href="https://github.com/EricChiang/pup"><code>pup</code></a> is the same &#8212; it&#8217;s a little app, inspired by the excellent <code>jq</code>, into which I can pipe <span class="caps">HTML</span> and give it a <span class="caps">CSS</span> selector, and <code>pup</code> will then print just the elements which match the selector. But how do I install it? <code>go get github.com/ericchiang/pup</code>. No. I don&#8217;t have go. I don&#8217;t have a go environment set up. I don&#8217;t have <code>$GOPATH</code> set. I shouldn&#8217;t even have to care that this little util is even <em>written</em> in Go. It&#8217;s a utility. What&#8217;s worse about this is that, unlike Ruby or Python, Go creates <em>actual executables</em>; I don&#8217;t even need the Go system around to run it! Why should I need to install all of Go just to get your app? Don&#8217;t use a language-specific library packaging system for distribution of applications. Don&#8217;t make me identify and download dependencies myself just because <em>you</em> already have&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>This is sorta kinda solved by <code>brew</code> for Mac users, but there&#8217;s a lot of stuff not in <code>brew</code> either. Still, there <em>is</em> willingness to solve it that way by having a packaging system. But it&#8217;s annoying that Ubuntu <em>already has one</em> and people are loath to use it. Using it makes for a better developer user experience. That&#8217;s&nbsp;important.</p>
