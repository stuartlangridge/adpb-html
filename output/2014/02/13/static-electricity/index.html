			<p>So here I am with a static blog.</p>
<p>I was on Wordpress. I like Wordpress; in particular, I like the vitality of
it. There's a large community of people using it and working on it and making
plugins and making themes, and it's become apparent to me over the years that
one of the things I care about quite a lot, when using software which is not a
core part of what I do, is that I do not have to solve <em>every</em> problem that I
have myself. That is: I would like there to be the problem-solving method of
"1. google for desired outcome; 2. find someone else has written a plugin to
do it", rather than "1. google; 2. find nothing; 3. write code". What this
means is using some project with a largeish community. So I settled on
<a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, because it's one of the more popular static
blog engines out there, and hence vibrant community.</p>
<p>At this point there will be questions.</p>
<p><strong>If you wanted a vibrant popular community why didn't you use
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>?</strong></p>
<p>I couldn't work out how to install it.</p>
<p>It says: <code>gem install jekyll</code>. I did that and it says <code>Permission denied -
/var/lib/gems/1.9.1</code>. So for some reason a command run as me wants to install
things in a system-level folder. No. System level belongs to apt. Let the word
go throughout the land.</p>
<p>I'm sure that it's entirely possible to configure RubyGems so that it installs
things in a <code>~/gems</code> folder or something. But I don't want that either: I want
this stuff to be self-contained, inside the project folder. Node's <code>npm</code> gets
this completely right and I am impressed down to the very tips of my toes with
it. Python gets it rightish: you have to use a <code>virtualenv</code>, which I am doing.
Is there a <code>virtualenv</code>-equivalent for Ruby and RubyGems? Almost certainly.
But I'm not trying to learn about Ruby, I'm trying to set up a blog. Reading
up about how to configure Ruby package installation to be in the project
folder when you're trying to set up a blog isn't just yak-shaving, it's like
an example you'd tell a child to explain what yak-shaving <em>is</em>. So no Jekyll
for me, which is a bit annoying, but not too much since Pelican looks good.
And I know Python pretty well, and don't like Ruby very much, so that's also
indicative.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you using a static blog engine at all? What was wrong with Wordpress?</strong></p>
<p>It got owned. I got an email from a friend of mine saying "hey, did you know that
if you look at your blog in an old browser, such as Dillo, there's a bunch of spam
at the top of it?"</p>
<p>I did not know. But it was the case. Sigh.</p>
<p>There are plenty of guides around about how to fix this: dump the DB, reinstall
Wordpress, restore the DB, then look for fixes, etc, etc, etc. And I thought: wow,
that's a bunch of effort and what do I get for it? I'm still vulnerable to exactly
the same problem, which is that an upgrade to WP happens, it notifies me, I notice
thirty nanoseconds later, and in that thirty nanoseconds some script bot somewhere
0wns the blog. I could, in theory, fix this by spending much more time setting up
something to auto-update WP, but in practice that's hard: what do I do, <code>svn update</code>
every fifteen seconds in a cron job? Nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>So, what am I getting from Wordpress that I'll lose if I go static?</strong></p>
<p>My list of plugins contains a bunch of stuff which is only relevant because it
<em>is</em> Wordpress and thus dynamic: caching, spam, that sort of thing. Static
sites don't need any of that. I like Jetpack a lot; it gives me a nice mobile
theme and stats, and I'll lose that (as well as comment moderation from a
mobile app, which I don't care about if I don't have comments; see below). I
have a bunch of nice little plugins which throw in features that I like, such
as adding footnotes, which I'll lose. Counterbalance that with how it's
basically impossible to put a &lt;script&gt; element in a Wordpress post,
which is incredibly annoying. I won't be able to create posts if I'm away from
my computer (without doing a bunch of setup), but in practice I don't do that,
it turns out. And finally, comments.</p>
<p>Hm, comments. On the one hand, I like my commenters; there have been
interesting discussions there, and normally informative. On the other hand,
there's a lot less commenting on blogs going on these days; you get much more
real-time discussion on Twitter or G+ about a post than you do on the post
itself. That's a bit  worrying -- you're losing the in-one-place nature of the
conversation, and their bit of the conversation might vanish from the public
discourse if G+ shuts  down, which is why I don't like Disqus -- but that's
happening <em>anyway</em> and can't be  stopped. So maybe I can live with it.</p>
<p>Also, themes, but Pelican has a bunch, including rather excellently the same
theme I was using on Wordpress! So it looks like nothing changed! Rawk.</p>
<p>So, let's see how it goes. Possibly I'll find something else critical that I'm
missing and migrate back... and I do still have to write a footnotes plugin...
but so far we're feeling good about it.</p>
