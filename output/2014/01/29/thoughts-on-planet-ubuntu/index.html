		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Recently, Randall Ross has been laying out <a href="http://randall.executiv.es/pu-more-awesome-conclusion">thoughts on Planet Ubuntu</a>
after analysing a survey he did. His conclusions are strong and
wide-ranging: that Planet Ubuntu should be the place for authoritative
goings-on from those who are passionate about making Ubuntu; that it's
currently full of random titbits of unrelated content; that staying "on
topic" should be baked into the system.</p>
<p>I really, <em>really</em> do not agree.</p>
<p>You see, the thing that Ubuntu has that everything else does not is our
<em>community</em>. I read Planet Ubuntu because I care about us, the people
who make this thing. Years ago, back when Planet Gnome was the place
where all the innovation relevant to Ubuntu was happening, they used to
have this argument: that Planet Gnome should only be about Gnome, not
about Gnome <em>people</em>. To their credit, they always resisted this push.</p>
<p><strong>The thing that Ubuntu has that everything else does not is our
<em>community</em></strong>. I care about the people more than I care about the
technology. I care that <a href="http://tonywhitmore.co.uk/blog/2014/01/27/helen-thompson/">Tony from the Ubuntu UK podcast worked for someone who raised funds for the Philippines</a>. I care that <a href="http://snwh.org/blog/2014-01-27-potentially-vegan-chocolate-cheesecake">Sam took a break from the Moka icon project to make cheesecake from tofu</a>. I care
that <a href="http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/my-geekhouse-frame">Mako rides pink bikes</a> and that <a href="http://princessleia.com/journal/?p=9033">Elizabeth likes pink keyboards as well as marketing Xubuntu</a>. Because we're a community. Because
we're more than just what we do for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Your Ubuntu news does not come solely from Planet Ubuntu. If I want to
see every detail of how the sausage is made, every aspect of how Ubuntu
comes from the minds of our people to the disk on my laptop, I'll read
the <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/date.html">ubuntu-phone</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/">ubuntu-devel</a> mailing lists. Mostly, I want
<em>curated</em> news. I want someone else to choose what's worthy of my
attention and highlight it for me. And Joey does a fantastic job of that
at <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/">OMG Ubuntu</a>, followed up by <a href="http://iloveubuntu.net/">ILU</a> or <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/">Web Upd8</a> or
<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/newsTag/Ubuntu">Softpedia</a>. I love reading the in-depth writeups that appear on
Planet Ubuntu, whether it's <a href="http://popey.com/blog/2014/01/28/january-2014-core-apps-hack-day-three-file-manager-and-calculator/">popey summarising the Ubuntu core apps hack days</a> or <a href="http://www.outflux.net/blog/archives/2014/01/27/fstack-protector-strong/">Kees going into deep detail on gcc security</a>, but there's
more to life, there's more to our community, than just the techie
details. When Ubuntu gets something large and new from Canonical it'll
be on The Verge and Engadget and Forbes; when there are important
announcements they'll be on the Fridge; when there's a cool hack it'll
be on the mailing lists and IRC. What I want is a place where we are
one. Where the Ubuntu community can come together to be one family. I am
what I am because of what we all are. Not because of what we all do.
Because of what we all are. That means that Lyz is more than just PLUG,
that Sam is more than just an icon designer, that Joey is more than just
a reporter. We're together. Don't let that go. Don't let Planet Ubuntu,
don't let <em>our thing</em>, be changed to be a place where you have to be
"authoritative", where "random titbits" are forbidden, where being
"on-topic" is more important than being friends. Let's let other places
do press releases, let other places enforce rules about being technical,
let other places insist that you mustn't talk "off-topic". And keep
Planet Ubuntu being a place where our community comes together.</p>
