			<p>As mentioned <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/11/29/enabling-webmentions/">yesterday</a> I've 
enabled <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention">webmentions</a> on this site. Now, webmentions could have the 
same spam problem that Pingback has, and so one of the proposed solutions is <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Vouch">Vouch</a>, 
where when you send a webmention you also include with it a "vouch URL". That URL is
a page which (a) links to <em>you</em>, and (b) is trusted by the person you're linking <em>to</em>. That way, the receiver can say: OK, I 
don't know this person who's linking to me, but I do know this other person, and she knows the first person, so I reckon 
they're probably OK. You can see an example of this on <a href="http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2014/10/17/1/vouch">Aaron Parecki's "replies" site</a>; one of the comments says 
"(vouched for by <a href="https://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4VUFr4/">waterpigs.co.uk</a>)".</p>
<p>Put your hand up if you can see a problem with this approach.</p>
<p>I think there are two problems; neither are insurmountable, but both are problems. The first is: how do you find a person
who will vouch for you and whom the recipient trusts? I think of this like, say, the problem of you, gentle reader, finding
out what my mobile phone number is. If you're reading this, then we're probably vaguely connected; we both work on the web,
or on Ubuntu, or both like Portishead, or something; we probably have some friends in common; there are lots of people out
there who know my mobile number; therefore, if you really wanted my number, you could play the "six degrees of 
<s>Kevin Bacon</s>Stuart Langridge" game and find someone who knows that number and trusts <em>you</em> enough to give it over. But
it's a really annoying task, because you don't know who to ask; all you can do is basically ping friends at random. In
particular, if there is actually <em>nobody</em> you know who knows my phone number, then you can't tell that; all you can do is
keep asking people and you'll never know whether you haven't found anyone because you haven't looked hard enough, or
because we're not good enough friends and so there's nobody out there to find. You could look for an unlimited time.</p>
<p>I do not like things that could make me work for an unlimited amount of time.</p>
<p>Second issue: the <em>clique problem</em>. If you only accept vouches from people you trust, then there's no easy way to <em>get</em> 
trusted. It makes it much, much harder for an outsider with something to say to get themselves heard. Now, some people
like that: they want discussions to be among known people only, and that's fine. But I don't really like the idea of
institutionalising that by baking it into the core protocol.</p>
<p>Since Vouch exists in large part to avoid spam, I thought: hey, what if we build a thing which will vouch for you if you
prove you're not a spammer?<sup id="sf-vouching-for-webmentions-hashing-for-vouches-1-back"><a href="#sf-vouching-for-webmentions-hashing-for-vouches-1" class="simple-footnote" title="Actually, I didn't quite think of this. I thought: why not prove you're not a spammer  directly? And Michiel de Jong thought of the idea of proving it to a service which then  vouches for you, which is super clever because it piggybacks on the existing Vouch network, it allows people to trust &quot;autovouched&quot; mentions differently from &quot;personally vouched&quot; mentions, and it doesn't require everyone with an endpoint to update it.">1</a></sup> And then people will hopefully learn over time that being thus vouched 
for is valid, and then everyone wins. If you know someone who will vouch for you, then use them to do so; if you don't,
prove you're not a spammer and have the service vouch for you. If you receive a vouched for webmention from someone you
trust, great; if you receive one vouched for by the service, then satisfy yourself that the service works and then you
can give it some limited degree of trust. So it's not <em>necessary</em> to use this sort of service, but it
can help to make a bridge from one "circle of trust" to another, or to help someone get involved in the conversation
even if they're new to the group. We had a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-11-29#t1417292682908">really interesting discussion</a>
about all this on the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC">#indiewebcamp IRC channel</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>So I built <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141130155500/http://web.archive.org/web/20141130155500/https://hash-for-vouch.herokuapp.com">Hash for Vouch</a>. A simple service: you do a little bit of computational work 
(a <a href="http://hashcash.org">hashcash</a>-style algorithm), and the service verifies that you did the work and then puts up a page 
which vouches for you, which you can send along with your webmention. There's an API so you can do the work and then prove 
it to get a vouch URL programmatically, or you can use the form on the front page to do that work in your browser and get 
a vouch URL that way. Spammers can't do the work because it makes spam uneconomical if each one takes five seconds to send.
And anyone real can join the conversation.</p>
<p>I'm now sending webmentions which are vouched for by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141130155500/http://web.archive.org/web/20141130155500/https://hash-for-vouch.herokuapp.com">Hash for Vouch</a> when I link to
URLs on this site. Feel free to do the same!</p><ol class="simple-footnotes"><li id="sf-vouching-for-webmentions-hashing-for-vouches-1">Actually, I didn't quite think of this. I thought: why not prove you're not a spammer
