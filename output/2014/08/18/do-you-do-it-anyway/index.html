			<p>Let us imagine that you are a designer, designing a <em>thing</em>. Doesn&#8217;t matter here what the <em>thing</em> is; it might be a piece of software or a phone or a car or a coffee machine or a tea cup. Further imagine that there are already lots of people using this <em>thing</em>, and a whole bunch of those people legitimately want it to do something that it currently does not. You&#8217;d like the <em>thing</em> to have this feature, but importantly you can&#8217;t work out how to add it such that it&#8217;s beautifully integrated and doesn&#8217;t compromise any of the other stuff. (That might be because there genuinely is no way, or just because you haven&#8217;t thought of one yet, and obviously the second of those looks like the first one to&nbsp;you.)</p>
<p>The fundamental question dividing everyone into two camps is: <em>do you do it&nbsp;anyway?</em></p>
<p>If you add the feature, then you&#8217;ll either do so relatively visibly or relatively invisibly. If it&#8217;s relatively visible then it will compromise the overall feel of the thing and maybe make it more difficult to use its existing features (because you can&#8217;t think of a seamless brilliant way to add it, so it will be unseamless and unbrilliant and maybe get in the way). If you add it relatively <em>in</em>visibly, then most people will not even discover that it exists and only a subset of those will actually learn how to use it at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t add it, then lots of people who could benefit from it, want it, and <em>could</em> have it aren&#8217;t allowed, <em>even if</em> they&#8217;re prepared to learn a complex way to make it&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>These two camps, these two approaches, are contradictory, in opposition, irreconcilable, and equally&nbsp;valid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the &#8220;equally valid&#8221; bit that people have trouble&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>This war is played out, day after day, hour after hour, in every field of endeavour. And not once have I ever seen anyone become convinced by an argument to switch to the other side. I <em>have</em> seen people switch, and lots of them, but it&#8217;s a gradual process; nobody reads a frantic and shrill denunciation of their current opinion and then immediately crosses the&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>There are also many people who would protest this division into two opposing camps; who would say that one should strike a balance. Everyone who says this is lying. It is not possible to strike a balance between these two things. You may well believe yourself to straddle this divide like an Adonis, but what that actually means is that sometimes you&#8217;re in one camp and sometimes you&#8217;re in the other, not that you&#8217;re simultaneously in both. Saying &#8220;well, you should add the feature, but as sensitively as possible&#8221; means &#8220;if it can&#8217;t be done sensitively, I&#8217;ll do it anyway&#8221;. Saying &#8220;it&#8217;s important to be user-focused, not feature-focused&#8221; means &#8220;people don&#8217;t get to have this thing even if they want it&#8221;. Doubtless you, gentle reader, would disagree with one of those two characterisations, which proves the point. Both views are equally valid, and they&#8217;re in opposition. If you&#8217;re of the opinion that it should be possible to straddle this divide, then help those of your comrades who can&#8217;t yet do so; help the do-it-anyways to understand that it&#8217;s sometimes better to leave a thing out, and help the deny-it-anyways to understand that some of their users are happy to learn about a thing to get best use from it. But if you&#8217;re already in one camp, stop telling the other camp that they&#8217;re wrong. We have enough heat and not enough light&nbsp;already.</p>
