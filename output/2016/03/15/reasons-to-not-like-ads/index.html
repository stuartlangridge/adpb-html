		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce</a> linked to <a href="http://kagan.mactane.org/blog/?p=714">Kagan MacTane&#8217;s list of &#8220;reasons to use ad-blockers&#8221;</a>, and I thought it was pretty good. I&#8217;ve been describing people who want to use an ad-blocker really as falling into four categories; these obviously cross over a lot, and most people will have aspects of&nbsp;each.</p>
<h3>Ads are bad for&nbsp;privacy</h3>
<p>Primary concern here, ads that track you around the internet. Advertising <em>itself</em> isn&#8217;t so bad; it&#8217;s when the ad networks build up a list of sites you look at by dropping tracking cookies on you, and then create a profile of you and what you do and what you care about. There are potential benefits here &#8212; if you&#8217;re going to see adverts, then they might as well be for stuff you&#8217;re interested in, right? &#8212; but in a post-Snowden world, having this sort of profile of you available to a company who may not have your best interests at heart and may hand it over to whoever asks for it when compelled or paid isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing. People who feel this way find that worrying. You can see your <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Google ads profile</a> from your Google account, and get a sense of the sort of demographic information that has been built up about you, and you can change your list of interests or opt out entirely; most ad networks don&#8217;t have this level of control. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"><span class="caps">EFF</span>&#8217;s Privacy Badger</a> browser extension is primarily designed to alleviate this sort of worry, by permitting ads but removing any tracking cookies, or blocking ads and script requests that attempt to do&nbsp;tracking.</p>
<h3>Ads are bad for&nbsp;performance</h3>
<p>Primary concern: that a page full of adverts loads much more slowly, because the script in the ads holds up the page, and because the ads themselves take a lot of time to download. <a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/">Les Orchard did a great job analysing The Verge</a> and showed that an article with 57K of <span class="caps">HTML</span> also included nearly <span class="caps">10MB</span> of ads and took thirty seconds to download. (The Vox Media team are <a href="http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/5/6/8561867/declaring-performance-bankruptcy">working on it</a>.) It&#8217;s quite startling how much faster a page is when it&#8217;s not downloading 200 times its own weight in extra advert code; this is what&#8217;s behind the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/"><span class="caps">AMP</span> <span class="caps">HTML</span></a> initiative, although it&#8217;s not clear whether that serves the needs of people solely or whether it&#8217;s a bit of a landgrab by a few big companies. But it&#8217;s nonetheless a response to this performance issue, and I suspect that the only reason more people do <em>not</em> identify themselves with this concern over performance is that they don&#8217;t <em>realise</em> how much faster the web ought to be when done right. (Also, here, see Progressive Web&nbsp;Apps.)</p>
<h3>Ads are visually&nbsp;disruptive</h3>
<p>A fair few people don&#8217;t necessarily mind adverts as a concept but dislike the actual ads we&#8217;ve got, because they animate or flash colours or move around or play a video when you inadvertently mouse over them; that is, they&#8217;re distracting and terrible. People who feel like this tend not to mind, for example, text ads on the side of a set of search results, but don&#8217;t like awful flashing things. It makes it difficult to see what you&#8217;re actually reading. One of the larger offences in this particular category are ads which make a page&#8217;s content jump around; the ad appears after page load and pushes everything below it down, leading to immense annoyance on the part of someone reading the pushed-around thing (and screwing up the scroll position if you&#8217;ve just hit&nbsp;Back).</p>
<h3>I shouldn&#8217;t have to see any ads at&nbsp;all</h3>
<p>And then there are those who feel that they ought to not see any ads whatsoever, and if publishers have a problem with that, then the publishers need to solve&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the important point. In general, complaints about ad blocking (from publishers, from adtech companies, from ad networks, and the like) tend to assume that everyone&#8217;s solely and completely in the last category. That is: the argument that ad blockers are bad goes &#8220;you just don&#8217;t care about how we fund the stuff that you read for free&#8221;. This is, I suggest, not the case for everyone. Yes, there are some people &#8212; plenty of people &#8212; who <em>just don&#8217;t want any ads</em>, and take a brutal and blasé attitude (&#8220;it&#8217;s not my problem you&#8217;re relying on a crappy business model&#8221;), and ignore the very tragedy-of-the-commons outcome of this (if everyone does it, we break everything). But, I think (and I&#8217;d love to see data on this, beyond the anecdata I have from talking to people) that some if not most people don&#8217;t dislike ads <em>qua</em> ads, they dislike <em>the ads we get</em>. Because the ads we get are visually distracting, privacy-invasive, and slow down the web to the point of ridiculousness. Maybe if adverts didn&#8217;t track us around the internet, didn&#8217;t screw up reading a page, and didn&#8217;t take thirty seconds to load, everyone wouldn&#8217;t be so quick to blame &#8220;ads&#8221; and could instead blame &#8220;bad&nbsp;ads&#8221;.</p>
<p>But&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s too late, now. I suspect it&#8217;s quite possible that the ad industry has pissed so comprehensively in this waterhole that there&#8217;s no way to come back from this and offer ads that can fund producers and aren&#8217;t&nbsp;dreadful.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m&nbsp;wrong.</p>
