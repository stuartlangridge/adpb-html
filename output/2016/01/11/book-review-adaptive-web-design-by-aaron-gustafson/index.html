		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>There's been a lot of talk over the years and especially recently 
about progressive enhancement: building things for the Web that work, 
that are 
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/06/28/availability/">available</a> 
to all, whether that's people in a bad cellphone area or people on 
dodgy hotel wifi or people with a Windows phone or cognitive issues 
or Safari on some retina screen in a coffee shop. And one of the lead 
voices in that discussion has been <a href="https://aaron-gustafson.com/">Aaron 
Gustafson</a> who has just written a book. 
It's called <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/adaptive-web-design-crafting-rich-experiences-with-9780134216140">Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with 
Progressive Enhancement, Second 
Edition</a>. 
Bit of a mouthful as a title, but it's worth it. I won't give a tldr 
because it's <em>not</em> too long and I <em>did</em> read it, but the short 
version is: this book is worth your time. And I was sent a free copy 
to review, I should note. </p>
<p>It surprised me to discover that it's not actually really a technical book. Well, it is of course -- it's 
useless to you if you're not building things for the Web, and it's 
full of code snippets -- but it's not just about HTML or about server 
technologies or whatever. It's got lots of advice on how to write 
copy, on design, on how to think about building the Web. It's not, if 
I'm honest, a single book putting together and proposing a single 
idea; it's more a collection of related relevant stuff that broadly 
fits under the heading. It's "How To Do My Job, by Aaron Gustafson", 
if you will. </p>
<p>I agree with most of it. Making your Web stuff available 
to everyone is not just a conversation about the technology; it 
<em>does</em> involve thinking about all of your design and your technology 
and your strategy and your copy. Technology is the least important 
bit, most of the time. </p>
<p>I have a few complaints, mind. Some minor nitpicking and some... well, some a bit more serious. </p>
<p>On the nitpicking front, the clear leader is that all the links in the book 
(I have the epub ebook version) are to shortened perma.cc URLs. In 
any book this would annoy me; in one such as this which waxes 
rhapsodic about the Web as a platform it's practically criminal. I 
have no idea where these links go. Yes, it's a link archiving 
service, but being able to see what the link actually <em>is</em> is also 
important! And, as Pat Lauke 
<a href="https://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke/status/682537945950208000">notes</a>, 
sometimes the service goes down, which it did over New Year 2015. 
Full credit to Aaron for getting on their case, and it came back 
after some time, but in the interim I was entirely lost. Yes, there's 
a risk -- nay, a certainty -- that over time the book will become 
less and less useful as the links therein head off to the 404 
Promised Land. But perma.cc is a single point of failure; it fails, 
as we've seen; and even if it doesn't, it's useless without the 
Internet. I feel strangely reluctant to visit links with no 
indication whatever of what they're for; I feel the same way about 
URL shortened links. At least if I had the URL I could punch it into 
archive.org, and maybe making sure they were all <em>there</em> would have 
been a better use of time. </p>
<p>There's also a little bit of a tendency to 
go for the sonorous quotable soundbite even if it undermines the 
point: as an example, take "The purpose of design is not to make 
something pretty; it’s to clarify." Nice quotable sentiment, but no 
it isn't. It's to do both. The aesthetic usability effect is a real 
thing. People like things more when they're pretty, and they 
objectively find things easier to use when they're pretty, all else 
being equal. Certainly being pretty at the expense of clarity is a 
bad thing (Aaron himself says rather elegantly that "beauty has its 
place, but a beautiful, unusable thing is not design; it’s art") and 
you can doubtless name a number of products which do exactly that. 
But being clear and not pretty is just as bad, because then nobody 
uses your thing. </p>
<p>There are places where warnings are given but 
solutions are not. "Remember Jason Samuels and the 1,000 different 
screen sizes he was seeing every quarter? You can’t design every one 
of those experiences", says our author.  But the counter argument is: 
we'll design the important ones (which normally means "the designer's 
iPhone and the designer's high dpi macbook") and the rest aren't 
important. Having more ammunition to counter this claim would have 
been nice. The next page actually gives such designers the excuse 
they need by saying that it'd be foolish to not do this! "That 
content is largely lost to history because the format evolved in a 
way that made newer versions of Word incapable of reading those older 
files." Agreed entirely. Now, how do we stop people repeating the 
same mistake by buying an iPhone? There's the aesthetic usability 
effect again. </p>
<p>But there is a larger complaint, and it's related to 
the desire to make important-sounding pronouncements. Firstly, 
though, cards on the table: I am at <em>least</em> as guilty of this as 
Aaron is, and likely more. So know that I say it with love. </p>
<p>You see, there's very little in the way of problems, things to be overcome in 
our industry, in building for the web, that we honestly don't know 
how to solve. There's not much where everyone's scratching their 
heads and saying, well, this is just difficult, sorry. Most things 
are known. Some are known better than others, and some are certainly 
<em>explained</em> better than others; doing that explanation is why books 
such as this exist. But that ain't the secret. The secret is that 
most people who work on the web aren't Aaron. They don't know; they 
don't follow; they don't read. And a part of that is because some of 
them don't care, but most people do. No, the reason most web 
developers don't leap into action to make great things is that most 
of what we say just doesn't seem relevant to them. It's all well and 
good saying "start by writing the kind of copy you want to read", but 
what do you do when you're writing the safety manual for an airport? 
Or a table of delivery instructions? And when last time you did this 
you put in a bit of a joke to make the copy better and nearly got 
fired for it? I've heard a bunch of people -- to be clear, <em>not</em> 
Aaron -- say "well, just don't take on clients with boring work" or 
"quit your job and do something you enjoy instead". Would that 
everyone were that lucky, Mr Rock Star Consultant Bloke. And there's 
a touch of this attitude in some of this book: "We often use fake 
text... while we are waiting for 'final, approved copy' (as though 
such a thing exists)." You know, I know, everyone knows that there 
isn't any magic anointed "final approved copy", but that doesn't mean 
that a developer can <em>act</em> like they know that. Superstar consultants 
can. People on the front lines normally can't, even if they know it 
for the truth. And I think this prevailing attitude -- the "if you 
don't like your job, quit and get a better one" -- turns off people 
in our industry who want to do better but don't have the free hand 
that, say, I do. This is something I want to work on in myself during 
2016.</p>
<p>But all this is beside the point. The book is worth it. Whatever 
you do on the web there'll be something in this book you didn't 
know and will be better off for 
knowing. <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4272">Jeremy's datalist trick?</a> Well 
impressed. That feels like Duff's device must have done to C 
people. PageRank being named for Larry rather than because it 
ranks pages? Blimey. So, good work, Aaron. People: read this book. </p>
