			<p>In an effort to prove that I am not <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/10/03/off-to-austin">like Jono</a>, I come before you to
speak now of poetry. Specifically, jazz poetry. More specifically, the
poetry of <a href="http://www.springfield.k12.il.us/schools/lanphier/projects/lindsay/">Vachel Lindsay</a>, and to place our discussion right on the
button, his most-famous (probably) ode, <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/104/81.html">The Congo</a>. </p>
<p><em>Under one&#8217;s breath,&nbsp;parenthetically</em> </p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s called &#8220;The Congo (A Study of
the Negro Race)&#8221;, but we&#8217;re here to talk of rhyme and metre, not&nbsp;politics. </p>
<p><em>Inquisitively, as of a church&nbsp;mouse</em> </p>
<p>How&#8217;s your poetry
knowledge? Better than mine, no doubt. The world is divided into two
categories, those who think poetry is all effete verbiage and those with
a favourite poem. My favourites are all epics, by which I mean that
they&#8217;re long and they rhyme: <a href="http://charon.sfsu.edu/TENNYSON/TENNLADY.HTML">The Lady of Shalott</a>, with her magic web
and now-cracked mirror; Alan Moore&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb.mit.edu/user/marthag/text/lyrics/the_vicious_cabaret">This Vicious Cabaret</a>, which
isn&#8217;t even a poem but a song; Hiawatha, and Don Juan, and A Shropshire
Lad with its elevation of beer above Milton. Rightly so, since <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/web/milton/">Paradise Lost</a> doesn&#8217;t rhyme. Poems should rhyme. Yes they should; you know it
in your soul. And why should they rhyme? <em>Boomingly and with malice
aforethought</em> Because they are to be read aloud! Everyone knows this,
too! No-one <em>does</em> it, though. Unless you&#8217;re the sort of wet
bleeding-heart sap who goes to poetry readings, that is. (I must go to a
poetry reading one day.) As that great orator Josiah Bartlett told us,
<a href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/third/49warcrimes.html">words when spoken out loud for the purpose of oratory are music; they have rhythm and pitch and timbre and volume and these are the properties of music</a>. Which brings us back to jazz poetry, which is
both words and music and should be spoken out loud for the purpose of
oratory. Read <em>The Congo</em>. </p>
<p>The first verse: Fat black bucks in a
wine-barrel room, Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, Sagged and
reeled and pounded on the table, Pounded on the table, Beat an empty
barrel with the handle of a broom, Hard as they were able, Boom, boom,
<span class="caps">BOOM</span>, With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, Boomlay, boomlay,
boomlay, <span class="caps">BOOM</span>. <span class="caps">THEN</span> I had religion, <span class="caps">THEN</span> I had a vision, I could not
turn from their revel in derision. <span class="caps">THEN</span> I <span class="caps">SAW</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CONGO</span>, <span class="caps">CREEPING</span>
<span class="caps">THROUGH</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BLACK</span>, <span class="caps">CUTTING</span> <span class="caps">THROUGH</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">JUNGLE</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> A <span class="caps">GOLDEN</span> <span class="caps">TRACK</span>.</p>
<p><em>Lightly</em> </p>
<p>Read it out loud. You have to read it out loud to get at the
centre of the thing. With a <em>silk</em> um<em>brella</em> and the <em>handle</em> of a
<em>broom</em>. Hannibal Lecter tells Clarice Starling about the &#8220;pease
porridge hot&#8221; quality of Sammy the schizophrenic&#8217;s poetry: &#8220;the meter
varies but the intensity is the same.&#8221; <em>Pease porridge</em> in <em>the pot</em>,
nine days old. <em>Beat</em> an empty <em>barrel</em> with the <em>handle</em> of a <em>broom</em>.
It&#8217;s compelling, syncopated. Once you&#8217;ve started reading, it&#8217;s difficult
to stop. <em>Wistful and reflective</em> Speaking out loud for the purposes of
oratory is not as easy as it could be, I feel. This is much on my mind
with my agreement to speak at conferences. I&#8217;m not too bad at it; after
doing the reading at my aunt&#8217;s funeral I was asked if I was thinking of
becoming a priest, seemingly because I made eye contact with the
congregation rather than muffling my words into the lectern. That&#8217;s
because I treated it like a business presentation; perhaps a bit
unfeeling, but if I&#8217;d have chosen the reading then I would have put my
hands in my pockets and talked about how much I missed her, not recited
a passage from the Bible. I&#8217;d love to be able to do what Lindsay does in
<em>Congo</em>. Jed Bartlett&#8217;s speechwriter, Toby Ziegler, talks (in words
given him by <em>his</em> speechwriter, Aaron Sorkin) about <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/09/15/the_science_of_listener_attention.html">&#8220;the science of listener attention&#8221;</a>. If you can get your audience to follow the words
along, if they have to sit on their hands to avoid clapping the beat,
you&#8217;ve won. On <em>I&#8217;m Sorry, I Haven&#8217;t A Clue</em>, when they sing, sometimes
the audience will start clapping along with the song. Builds up a
rhythm, just like Toby says. Just like Lindsay says, &#8220;a rapidly piling
climax of speed and racket.&#8221; I&#8217;m dimly perceiving that this is the
approach of great speechmakers. Churchill repeated the word &#8220;fight&#8221;
about thirty times in quick succession in the speech everyone remembers.
You can be sure <em>he</em> wasn&#8217;t just reading off the bullet points on his
Powerpoint slide one after the other. These things turn from general to
specific pretty quick, you may have noticed. Those of you with
oratorical abilities, any suggestions are welcomed. Note that I&#8217;m not
trying to overcome stage fright here, nor am I inexperienced in public
speaking; I would, however, like to be better at&nbsp;it&#8230;</p>
