		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Got quite a few projects on the go, although they are on a bit of a
temporary hiatus while I finish the next book. (DOM fans, it’s not a
<span class="caps">DOM</span> book; it’s about setting up a
<acronym title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl"><span class="caps">LAMP</span></acronym>
server.) None of these projects have yet come to fruition, but they will
do and will be cool. The latest one I’ve come up with I am really
excited about, and I should have something runnable in the next few days
for people to play with.</p>
<p>In beer news, last night I drank a lot of beer, oh yes. It was the
Annual <a href="http://wolveslug.org.uk/">Wolves <span class="caps">LUG</span></a> big beer drinking night,
because it’s nearly <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/">Jono’s</a> birthday, and it’s just worked out that
that night is the big beer night. Actually, it wasn’t a massive beer
blast; instead, we ate a curry, drank a lot of Carling, and watched Ron
do an interesting talk on Asterisk and Voice-over-IP. I’m still of the
opinion that using VoIP right now is a bit like using the
<span title="not X Windows, so I'm told" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black">X
Window System</span> was five years ago; you have to configure stuff and
know loads of acronyms. Just like how setting up X meant you had to know
about ColorDepth and Visuals and Modelines and the refresh rate of your
monitor and what chipset your graphics card was, until Klaus Knopper and
Red Hat and lots of other people made the damned computer <em>work it out
for you</em> like it’s supposed to. Ron demonstrated some hardware
<span class="caps">SIP</span> phones, which look cool, and a lot more
successful than trying to use softphones like KPhone or LinPhone.
Personally, I think <a href="http://divmod.org/projects/shtoom">shtoom</a> has real potential as a softphone for
someone hacking on it and improving usability (I’d like to do this,
because it’s in Python and I can hack it), because the UI for a
softphone should be a window with one textbox that lets you enter a
phone number and <em>that’s all</em>. However, shtoom’s underlying VoIP
implementation isn’t quite good enough yet (and the shtoom guys
acknowledge this, and they’re working hard with it).</p>
<p>And yes, that’s one more project on my list that I’m not going to get to
for a while. I need to do some more contributing to free software
projects, I think. Gotta rebuild this website first, though. And finish
the book. And, y‘know, get thinner too. Too much to do. Anyway, where
was I? Ah, yes, usability. Havoc made me laugh with his <a href="http://log.ometer.com/2005-09.html#12">note on the Tor
design contest</a>. You see, <a href="http://tor.eff.org/index.html">Tor</a> is a thing that anonymises your
internet connection (it makes your connection bounce through a load of
servers before getting to the destination, so people can’t tell it’s you
connecting). It’s a bit of a bark to set up, though, so the Tor people
have announced <a href="http://tor.eff.org/gui/index.html">a UI design competition</a> to build a
<span class="caps">GUI</span> to configure and manage Tor while it’s
running. Havoc thought exactly the same thing I did: the “GUI” for Tor
should have one big tickbox on it which says “Enable anonymous internet
connection” and that’s all. If you have to show people <em>which</em> servers
your connection goes through or have them configure that or even <em>care</em>
about it then you’re doing it wrong, I think.<br>
I need to install my own web-based <span class="caps">RSS</span>
aggregator. I’m tired of Bloglines being down and slow and not telling
me how many of the “unread” messages it indicates next to each weblog
name are actually “Keep New” messages. Anyone got any suggestions? I’m
trying to avoid the urge to write one—q.v. big list of projects above.</p>
