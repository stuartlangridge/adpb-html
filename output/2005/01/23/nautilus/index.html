			<p>I like Nautilus, the Gnome file manager. Having said this, I’m trying to
not refer to it as “Nautilus“; I’d like the fact that it’s an
<em>application</em> to disappear. Like the Mac, I’d like it to just be that my
desktop shows folders. Not “my desktop starts Nautilus to show the
contents of a folder“. The Nautilus window <em>is</em> the folder. It’s all
spatial, see?<br>
Anyway, a gripe and a wish about this non-existent application.<br>
The gripe is: Ctrl+T is bound to “Send to Trash“. This is an
unbelieveably shit idea, because Ctrl+T is “New Tab” in Firefox. So, if
you hit Ctrl-T when you think that your Firefox window is focused, but
instead a folder has the focus, then <em>whatever is selected gets
deleted</em>. This is the World’s Worst Idea. One of the things you’re
supposed to do when implementing new stuff is look at the failure modes;
what if it goes wrong? Now, this is, of course, not the Nautilus
people’s fault, and neither is it the Firefox people’s fault. It’s just
unfortunate. What is <em>not</em> unfortunate, though, is that there is <em>no
way</em> to change that Nautilus keybinding. I’m not asking for keys to be
arbitrarily rebindable: this is not <span class="caps">KDE</span> we’re
talking about. But I can’t make it go away, and today I deleted two
folders by mistake because of it. Fortunately, I could fish them back
out of the Trash. <em>Unfortunately</em>, the Trash is crap; the Windows
Recycle Bin is a lot, lot better, because things in the Recycle Bin know
where they came from and can be put back there with a mouse click. The
Trash is just another folder somewhere, as far as I can tell. And if you
delete something by mistake, because it was highlighted, <em>you don’t know
what it was that you deleted</em>. It’s only because I know the folder that
was showing well that I could pull out of my head what the thing I’d
deleted was. This is bad, and I do not know how to fix it.<br>
<strong>Update</strong>: it seems to be removed in later versions of Nautilus. It
went away in version 1.647.4.3, as can be seen from the <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c?r1=1.647.4.2&amp;r2=1.647.4.3">diff</a> (search
for “accelerator =” to find the line that disappears), even though,
rather bizarrely, the <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c#rev1.647.4.3">changelog</a> doesn’t really say anything about
it. Anyway, looks like it’ll be gone in 2.10, which I’ll get when hoary
gets stable.<br>
The wish is: can we have TortoiseSVN for Gnome, please please please?
It’d be really handy. The “nautilus-python”: bindings should make it
pretty easy to handle this—Nautius already supports WebDAV, after
all—but they seem to be pretty new and untried and (more importantly)
not packaged for Ubuntu, more’s the pity. People are using them for cool
stuff like <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/archives/2004/10/27/creative-commons-support-in-gnome">displaying Creative Commons licences that apply to
particular files</a> and I want some of that customise-my-folders action.
Especially if I can make folders know that they are Subversion working
copies.</p>
