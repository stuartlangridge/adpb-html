			<p>It’s my birthday. Ha haa!<br>
Those of you who have enjoyed the guessing games from previous years
(<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/01/30/revolution">2003</a> <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/31/birthdays">2004</a>) may have a bit more difficulty this year; I can’t
find anything interesting to say about my age this year. It’s not a
cube, it’s not perfect, it’s not a third power. Even the Wikipaedia
struggles before coming up with such lame attempts as it being the
atomic number of copper and the number of bones in the skull, although
it <em>is</em> prime (and apparently a primorial and Sophie Germain and half a
twin prime as well). In fact, I would almost go so far as to say that it
is the first number without any interesting properties, except that (and
those of you who know some maths will already know this bit) that being
the lowest dull number is in itself an interesting property, and
therefore it is an interesting number after all! Interesting solely in
its dullness. I know a couple of people like that.<br>
Anyway, this new release of Stuart Langridge Esq does leave me staring
down the barrel of middle age; the next milestone on my personal road to
death has the number “30” carved on it. Ouch. I’ll be thirty! And have a
sports car, which means that people will accuse me of having a midlife
crisis. Not the Faith No More song, either. Nevertheless, it is my
birthday. Had a very entertaining meal last night with Jono and Sooz,
cut short when Niamh was sick (which was not nice). I hope she feels
better today; everyone has been ill recently. Mr Bacon himself has been
struck the worst, actually getting bronchitis, but Sam’s been off work
for a week, I was off for two days, Sooz is starting to get it now as
well; what hideous disease is it that is ripping through my family and
friends? Maybe someone at work gave it to me. Anyone want to offer me a
different job? Drop me a mail :)<br>
It is nice to have a birthday, though. I’m going shopping for clothes,
because I don’t have enough. More news on that as it happens.</p>
