			<p>I spend a lot of time in front of my computer. Probably more than most.
So I want to make sure that I spend as little time as possible keeping
my system running. Many years ago I used to use a Windows PC and
estimate that I’d spend around 2% of my time keeping the system in good
working order. That could be installing software or patches, defragging
the disk, or the occasional OS reinstall. Not a huge amount of time, but
it does add up. These days I use Linux, and the amount of time I spend
on maintenance has easily dropped below 0.01%.</p>
<p>Because I use my computer all the time, I want it to be as pleasant an
experience as possible. I want my computer to help me do my work, or at
least not get in my way. At work I have to use Windows; while the OS has
definitely improved in the last few years, I still get the feeling that
I’m fighting against the OS rather than working with it. And while
Windows XP looks a little nicer than its predecessor, it still feels
miles behind Linux. Windows looks and feels cluttered and complex to me,
and the clean and usable lines of my Gnome desktop get out of my way and
let me get on with work.</p>
<p>Now before the Windows and Mac users go on the defensive, I’m not saying
that Linux is perfect. Like most computer systems, it has its quirks,
oddities and annoyances. However I truly believe that its the best
operating system around, because it not only works more smoothly but
also embodies an ethical stance. It will stay that way pretty much
indefinitely; neither Apple nor Microsoft show any significant sign of
moving away from proprietary formats, proprietary applications, and
forced user lockin.</p>
<p>I have quite a bit of time, money and emotional attachment invested in
Linux, so would hate for anything to happen to it. There have been a few
moments in recent history where there future looked uncertain, but the
growth of Linux in industry, along with the cooperation of large
corporate firms such as <span class="caps">IBM</span> and Novell (who
are mostly becoming involved with Free Software in a Free way rather
than simply trying to take advantage of others’ work for commercial
gain) seems to have secured its future, at least for the next couple of
years. However I want Linux to thrive and one perceived guarantee of
longevity is market share.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020472,39118695,00.htm" title="figure from 2003, which is the most recent I can find">Linux has a global market share of 2.8 percent on the
desktop</a>. It has <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=P5013_0_6_0_C" title="figure from 2004">a global market share on the server of 28.3%</a>.
While the server market is a stronghold for Linux, at first glance the
desktop figure seems pretty poor. However, it’s worth putting that in
perspective. 2.8% percent means that one in every 36 computers in the
world is running Linux. When you think about it, that�8364;’s actually
quite a lot.</p>
<p>Most of my friends and colleagues own at least one Linux box, and at
conferences like What The Hack and <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span>, the
halls are swarming with them. In fact spying a Windows box at one of
these events is a cause for a raised eyebrow or two.</p>
<p>Linux doesn’t have a huge cut of the larger computer market, but it does
have a strong showing in the developer sector. A good portion of
developers I know are using Linux or are in the process of trying it
out, which is made easy by the existence of Live CDs. This site balances
between Linux, web technology, and me complaining about stuff; I don’t,
unfortunately, have stats for operating system share of visitors.</p>
<p>So while Linux’s market share may appear small, it is actually a lot
larger and more stable than you may imagine.</p>
