			<p>Yesterday, as previously mentioned, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/06/05/javascriptLove">lots of people met up to talk about
JavaScript</a>. I got to meet <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">ppk</a> and <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards</a> for the first
time, which was great. And we talked about things. The original idea was
to talk about some <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/11_june_london.html#link2">fairly heavy technical stuff</a> like what to do
about the onload handler, but after <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk/programme.php#behaviour">Jeremy’s presentation at @media
2005</a> it became clear that we need less effort going into solving
minor technical minutiae and lots more effort going into <span class="caps">PR</span> for&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>
<p>You see, developers out there seem to fall into the following&nbsp;categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who already know about the power of the
    <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOM</span></span> and unobtrusive scripting. A good
    proportion of whom were in the pub yesterday talking about&nbsp;this.</li>
<li>People who have bought into web standards, are using tableless
    design with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span>, don’t really know about
    JavaScript, but <em>want</em> to know more. This is a large proportion, we
    think, of current <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span>&nbsp;hackers.</li>
<li>People who used JavaScript a while ago and have since dismissed it
    because it was a pointless language that let you do image rollovers
    and make websites that <em>depended</em> on&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>People who haven’t bought into the web standards deal at&nbsp;all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly we can’t target everyone at once, and the consensus was that the
people to target are category 2, experienced
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span> hackers. The advantage here is that they
are <em>already</em> using clean markup and modern techniques; since
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOM</span></span> scripting pretty much requires this
approach, we don’t have to sell these people on the benefits of web
standards, because they’re already doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The major flaw, it seems, is that if you’re not a programmer then
JavaScript is a bit difficult to get to grips with, and
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span> designers are, in the main, not
programmers. For people like me, it’s easy to gloss over the basics:
what a variable is, what an array is, what an object is, what a function
is. You see, all the power and elegance in JavaScript, the thing that
makes it really great for putting together <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOM</span></span>
applications, is that objects and functions and arrays are <em>all the same
thing</em>. When you realise this then a whole vista of power opens before
you; if you get this and how the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">DOM</span></span> works
then everything else that’s doable, all the cool scripts and techniques,
becomes obvious. Pretty much,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>So, what we need is things that explain how the basics work. The issue
with that, though, which Dean Edwards pointed out, is that you’re not
trying to teach people JavaScript, you’re trying to teach them
programming. And that’s not all that easy. If you write a guide to what
variables and functions and objects and arrays are then <em>no-one will
read it</em> because that stuff is very, very, very boring. The approach we
kicked around was to carry on writing demonstrations of cool techniques,
but, when doing that, throw in a bit of a “basics” explanation on one
point. So, next time you write a reusable library to make tooltips
appear or something, in the explanation don’t just say “and we build a
list of all the tooltips”: explain what a list is and how it works.
Don’t try and explain <em>everything</em> from first principles, just one
thing. And over time, people can pick up cool reusable techniques, which
everyone likes, and learn about one important building block <em>at the
same time</em>. Look for articles along these lines from various&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://webstandards.org/">WaSP</a> are also going to hopefully get on board; there were four
WaSPs at the meeting, which helps (<a href="http://www.setmajer.com/">Chris Kaminski</a> being one I hadn’t
met before), and they have a lot of mindshare in the community, which
should&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>The brave new future we’ve talked about is coming. It’s time to show
everyone else how they can be part of&nbsp;it.</p>
