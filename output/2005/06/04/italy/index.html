			<p>Well, I’m back.<br>
Italy is really nice. Really nice.<br>
The pizzas are, too.&nbsp;Heh.</p>
<h4>What it was&nbsp;like</h4>
<p>We were in <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?local=h&amp;scale=50000&amp;lon=12.8708&amp;lat=45.5948">Caorle</a> which is a beautiful town on the Adriatic in
north-east Italy. Marvellous place. We’re going back next year, I
think.<br>
Everyone thought we were German, mainly because the vast majority of
their tourism seems to emanate from Germany, but that’s <span class="caps">OK</span> because my
German is better than my Italian :)<br>
I am also now the l33t Italian speaker, as long as (a) no-one takes my
phrasebook away, and (b) you want to say “can I smoke here?“, “can I
have the bill, please?“, “a bottle of still mineral water, please“, or
“how many stamps do I need on a postcard to England?“. One nice thing
about the Italian people, or at least that subset of them which works in
restaurants, is that they will applaud your stumbling attempts to speak
their lovely language. I lost count of the number of times that I got a
“bravissima!” when I hummed and hahed my way through the Italian for
“could I have another medium beer, please” or “the risotto was
delicious, thankyou“. That doesn’t happen in a lot of places—while I
don’t wish to cast aspersions (too much), some people will look down
their nose at you and pretend not to understand when you have a crack at
it. French waiters, I’m looking at you here. This contributes to the
stereotypical English tourist who merely speaks loudly and slowly in
English as if the other party is brain-damaged. The Germans who we
overheard were rather guilty of this, which surprised me slightly but
does at least explain why most of the waiters and waitresses could speak
some German; they are obliged to be able to do&nbsp;so.</p>
<h4>Photos, or, the lack&nbsp;thereof</h4>
<p>I would have lots of photos if my digital camera wasn’t knackered.
However, it is; it eats batteries. So, I’m in the market for a new one.
Here’s my list of requirements: I’m looking for suggestions as to what I
should buy. I’m quite happy to go second-hand on eBay or similar, so the
price can be for a second-hand&nbsp;one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Easy to use (point it, press the&nbsp;button)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;flash</li>
<li>Good quality pictures (i.e., can be printed out (by proper photo
    people, not by me) and not look like a digital&nbsp;photo)</li>
<li>Saves onto some form of card (not frigging Sony Memory&nbsp;Sticks)</li>
<li>Doesn’t eat batteries (this is&nbsp;important!)</li>
<li>I’m not sure whether it should take batteries or just plug in to
    recharge the internal battery <em>a la</em> a mobile phone—give reasons for
    your&nbsp;preference</li>
<li>£150 or&nbsp;less</li>
</ul>
<h4>Venice</h4>
<p>Venice is really massively overrated. Don’t bother with it. The Doge’s
palace is <span class="caps">OK</span>, but when you’ve seen one dark room with a dozen oil
paintings in you’ve seen them all, really. The Bridge of Sighs is not at
all what we were expecting, and neither was Venice, to be honest. Those
of you who have been there or have read something about it may feel smug
about your knowledge at this point, but for everyone else: what do you
think the Bridge of Sighs would be? Big lovely pretty bridge over a
glittering canal, right? Nope, it’s a thin enclosed stone bridge that
looks grim, and it’s called the Bridge of Sighs because it leads to the
prisons. Similarly, I was under the impression that basically all
transport in Venice was on the canals; if you wanted to go from any
point to any other point you had to do it by boat. Not at all; there are
paths and bridges everywhere. You could live your whole life in Venice
and never go on a boat. And the canals are grim and smell rather bad.
Massive letdown the whole place&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>So, all in all, it was a lovely week, and I’m glad to be back. Not glad
that I have to go back to my job the day after tomorrow, though. Bah.
It’s taken me nearly the whole day to catch up on mail and feeds and
forums and whatnot, too&nbsp;:-)</p>
