			<p>Well, the weekend of <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2005/">LugRadio Live 2005</a> is over. It was <em>brilliant</em>.
Really. If you missed it then you should be gutted, because it was&nbsp;brilliant.  </p>
<p>Ade, Jono, and I had a fun-filled day on Friday driving around the
place to buy loads of odd bits like ink pads and potatoes, and then Matt
arrived on Friday night for the big drinking session. That was the first
amazing thing: we turned up at the Hogshead pub in Wolverhampton to be
greeted by about 20 people who were already there. Twenty! That’s about
how many I was expecting to turn up at the actual event, and they were
there the night before! Lots of drinking went on that night; we ended up
in a dire nightclub called the Lighthouse. Funny story there: I was
wearing <a href="http://www.tshirthell.com/store/product.php?productid=247">this T-shirt</a> which says on the front “Rape is no laughing
matter“, and on the back “Unless you’re raping a clown“. I personally
think it’s hilarious, although I concede that some people think it’s
exceedingly offensive. Anyway, we go into the club, and there are two
women on the door. The first points at the front of my T-shirt and gives
me the thumbs-up—<em>right on, brother!</em> The second, obviously a bit wiser
as to the perfidious ways of men, asked me to turn around. I politely
refused, not wanting a knee in the testes. Anyway. A good night had by
all, I&nbsp;thought.  </p>
<p>The day arrived. I got woken up by Jono at about 7.30am, ouch. Packed
all the shit into his tiny, tiny Micra, and off to the Molineux stadium
to set up. Jono spent the next three hours rigging up the audio (he did
a fantastic job!); myself and the Bald put up the <a href="http://www.splashblog.com/andySpace/?albumid=2148&amp;pageno=1&amp;preview=48704">magnificent LugRadio Live banner</a> on the outside of the building. I was dead proud of how
good that looked, especially since the letters were just printed on A4
paper, laminated, and stuck on the back of Jono’s vinyl Seraphidian
banner. El Baldo de Maximo should be justifiably proud of how the banner
stayed attached to the building all day, since he worked out how to tie
it up and all I did was piss and moan about how he was doing it. Good
work bald man. I also got to carve out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/drewm/21619161/" title="see me attacking the Bald with it">official LugRadio Live 2005 potato stamp</a> with which to stamp people’s hands as they entered the
door, and sort out loads of other little bits before the doors opened at
11am. And people flooded in. Did they ever. We think (and it’s a bit
difficult to tell) that we had 250 people or so at peak point. That’s
something like double what we were expecting, and was a very pleasant
surprise indeed. We opened the show, and I got my first taste of fame: I
finished off the opening speech with “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome…to
LugRadio Live“, and everyone <em>cheered</em>. That’s a rush, that. Jono, being
an actual famous person who plays gigs all the time, was dead blasé
about it, but I’ve never performed in front of a cheering audience
before; all the public speaking I do is presentations and the like, and
no-one cheers at them. It was&nbsp;cool.  </p>
<p>The day went really well. Big thanks to Rufus Pollock, who stepped in
and did a main stage talk about software patents and threats to freedom
on about 30 minutes notice after Sarah Ewen pulled out. <a href="http://www.phillipsuk.org/photos/LUG-Radio-Live-2005/IMG_0015">Adam Sweet and his horrific suit</a> did a marvellous job running the lightning talks
room. I caught bits of a lot of talks; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/drewm/21615707/">Simon Willison’s talk on GreaseMonkey</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/008400.html">Gerv Markham’s phishing talk</a> were apparently
highlights, and I really enjoyed Drew McLellan’s talk about fixing your
open-source project’s website. I missed Colin Watson’s Ubuntu installer
talk, which is very annoying. In fact, I missed loads of things: I
didn’t see a single talk from start to end, I missed meeting up with
loads of people I wanted to speak to, like Mike Hearn and Omahn and
loads of people from the forums, and I didn’t get a chance to have a go
at the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LAN</span></span> gaming. I did get a chance to chat
to Brian Teeman about Mambo, though, and both he and Josette from
O‘Reilly seemed to have a laugh <em>and</em> sell loads of things, so they were
all pleased too :-) Matt chaired the Mass Debate, which got lots of good
responses; someone remarked at one point that Mark Shuttleworth barely
mentioned Ubuntu, while Kevin Carmony mentioned Linspire in every
sentence, but I think that contrast was what made them both good
additions to the&nbsp;panel.  </p>
<p>I had a total blast, and from what other people were saying they did
too. LugRadio Live and Unleashed was fantastic fun, as well; we got to
give out many silly awards, thank lots of people, call one another
names, and get cheered again. Great, great fun. It was <em>such</em> a good
day, and we’re definitely doing it again next year, especially if we can
get <a href="http://pictures.codepoets.co.uk/2005_06_-_LugRadioLive/the_event/?pic=44">Mark Shuttleworth to hold a sign again</a>. Oh, and do some more
T-shirts; the four of us each had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simon/21686353/">custom <span class="caps">LRL2005</span> T-shirts with <span class="caps">BALD</span>, <span class="caps">BEARD</span>, <span class="caps">GING</span>, and <span class="caps">ANGER</span> on the back</a>.&nbsp;Quality.  </p>
<p>The curry in the Standard was…complex, on the grounds that we had way
more people than we were expecting and the Standard totally couldn’t
deal with it. There were people who hadn’t even been served a starter by
the time that we’d finished our main courses. Red Hat paid for some of
the meal, which was great: they got a lot of good <span class="caps">PR</span> from that, for an
amount of money that they’ll probably make back by selling one copy of
Red Hat Enterprise Server, so everyone’s a winner there, I think. I also
got to meet <a href="http://www.hadess.net/?start=553" title="Bastian Nocera, really">Bastard No Sierra</a> who is a deeply funny bloke. Good
night out, despite being marred by the Standard’s poor performance. Next
year we’ll have a better idea of numbers and will go somewhere better
able to cope with the crowd, I&nbsp;think.  </p>
<p>On Sunday there was paintball, which lots of people really liked; me,
not really, because the mask almost broke my cheekbones every time I put
it on and I spent that day and all of the next day with a splitting
headache because of it. That aside, though, it was a really good
addition to the weekend; a group of people all doing stuff together, and
that’s what <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LRL</span></span> was all about; the community
having fun. A few of us sloped off for a dinner in a pub, while the bald
and Scott James Remnant both turned into lethal gritted-teeth
superkillers. I noted to Monsieur Bradshaw that his Rambo-esque
hypersoldier attitude was not exactly compatible with the Buddhist
unparticularised love for all things and he instructed me to fuck off.
:-) Seems like people had a great day,&nbsp;though!  </p>
<p>We (by which I mean Jono) are putting together both the video and audio
of the talks and LugRadio Live and Unleashed, and should hopefully be
releasing those for download in the next few days. That should be great;
Sooz and Craig did a superb job with the videoing, Jono’s audio stuff
seems to have come out perfectly, and I want to listen to it all&nbsp;again.  </p>
<p>We really had a few goals for <span class="caps"><span class="caps">LRL</span></span>: we want to
show people that a Linux event doesn’t have to be a big
corporate-dominated selling thing like the Linux Expo is, and I think we
succeeded. I want people to think, next year, “yeah, let’s go to that,
that’ll be really good!” When I go to the Expo, all the good bits are in
meeting people and having a drink with them, not in looking round a
stand while a guy in a suit tries to sell you Veritas Backup. I
appreciate that there are a lot of people who <em>do</em> want that from an
event, and the Expo is the thing for them; those people who go to the
Expo to meet others and enjoy themselves can hopefully think of LugRadio
Live as an alternative next year. Another major goal was to get the
LugRadio community together, and I think that that happened really well
too. Lots of people from the forums were there, and there was beer and
curry and paintball to share. It’s quite moving, how everyone pulls
together in times like that, and I’m really pleased (and stunned) at how
many people turned up and that they (almost) all seemed to enjoy it a
great deal. Roll on next&nbsp;year.</p>
