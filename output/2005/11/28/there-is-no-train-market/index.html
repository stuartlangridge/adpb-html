			<p>The other day, Niamh and I went down to London (to see <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:Cxu_gkIIOAsJ:adactio.com/journal/display.php/20051123221315.xml&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;strip=1" title="Google cached version of Jeremy's post, since adactio seems to be down right now">the Science Museum with the Britpack and Molly Holzschlag</a>) on the train. We first
drove to Coventry, and I bought a ticket there from one of the
QuickTicket machines where I can just drop my card in. An adult return
to London, and a child return to London. Cost me £36.00 for the two (£24
for me, £12 for Niamh), which I didn't think was too bad. We had a great
time at the Science Museum, doing <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adactio/tags/sciencemuseum/" title="Jeremy's pictures of the Science Museum trip">such fun things as electrocuting ourselves, admiring the Difference Engine, and stealing Meri's Jaffa Cakes</a>. And then we got on the train on the way home, going back to
Coventry. On that trip on the way home, a ticket inspector asked for our
tickets. I unveiled them, to be told that they weren't valid on Virgin
Trains (the exact comment was "we couldn't do a ticket as cheap as
that!"), and so I had to pay again. Sixty-six pounds worth of again, to
be precise. Put a bit of a damper on the whole thing, I can tell you.
The key point here is this. The privatisation of the rail services,
splitting it up into loads of different companies, seems design to force
a market on us where no market needs to exist. Virtually no-one I've
spoken to actually cares which train company is running the train they
are travelling on. The train companies are desperate to <em>make</em> us care,
but no-one actually does. Would you watch a train heading to your
destination go past because it was run by the wrong company? And so we
are suddenly forced to care when you discover that your "return to
London" is actually a "return to London on Chiltern Trains only", and
you have to pay a hugely inflated price for a second time. The same
situation has arisen with power companies; no-one actually cares or even
really understands the difference between nPower and Powergen and all
the others. The electricity I get from one isn't somehow better than
from the others; the price difference is minimal, and a labyrinthine
collection of "special" offers and complex pricing schemes makes it
difficult even to compute a pricing difference anyway. Mobile companies
used to be like this; if you were on Vodafone it was difficult to ring
people on Cellnet, or to send text messages. In the end, they all got
together and made it easier. I've got no problem with having separate
companies, but they need to understand that the ordinary punter does not
care about the difference, and model their business based on that fact
rather than trying to steal customers from another company.</p>
