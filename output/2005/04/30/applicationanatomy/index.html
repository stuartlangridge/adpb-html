		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I thought I’d put together some notes on how the <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/conposter/index.php">Tory poster generator</a> actually works, as an example of how I write a small web
application. While it is small, a reasonable amount of thought went into
its design, and those design principles are extendable (in a handwavy
sort of sense) to larger and more complex web&nbsp;apps.</p>
<h4>Introduction to the&nbsp;project</h4>
<p>What the Generator does, for those of you who haven’t tried it, is
create an image of a poster, by asking the user for some text to go on
said poster and then creating a downloadable
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PNG</span></span> with that text, in a particular font,
superimposed over an existing image. The font is one of a selection of
“handwriting” fonts which were available for free download; the user may
choose any of these fonts, or one will be randomly&nbsp;selected.</p>
<h4>Too many users spoil the&nbsp;broth</h4>
<p>The key point I had in mind with this app is that image generation is
pretty intensive. Since I had an idea in my head that the Generator
might turn out to be popular, I was worried that it would overwhelm the
machine that it’s on. The obvious way to build a web app like this would
be to have the image generation happen “in process“; that is, the
architecture looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Stage 1: request poster text from user; Stage 2: hang while generating image with PHP image library; Stage 3: Display page and newly created image" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/thumbnails/250/pictures/random/159.png"></p>
<p>The problem with that idea, where you generate the image in
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> code, is that the page hangs while you’re
waiting for the image to be generated. Moreover, if a thousand people
all request an image at once, then a thousand image generation
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> pages all run at once. That’s certain
death to the server, unless you’ve got a pretty studly server, which I
haven’t. So, time for a more efficient&nbsp;approach.</p>
<h4>A better&nbsp;way</h4>
<p>Instead of doing the generation “in process“, I decided to do it “out of
process“. So the bit the user sees and uses and the bit that actually
generates the images would be entirely different processes. The image
generation process would just run in the background on the server,
generating one image at a time, and the front end would just hand
“requests” for image generation to it, and then wait around until it was
done. Something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="Stage 1: request poster text from user; Stage 2: Add a request for image generation to the queue and wait until it's done; Stage 3: Display page and newly created image by retrieving the image from the storage area. Meanwhile, the back end daemon reads requests from the queue and places complete images in the storage area." src="http://www.kryogenix.org/thumbnails/250/pictures/random/160.png"></p>
<p>Separating the processes makes each part quick and easy. The front end
simply adds requests to the queue and then loads a “wait page”: this
page refreshes itself every five seconds and, on load, checks whether
its particular request has been completed, by looking for the completed
image in the storage area. If it has, redirect to the final page, which
shows the completed image. Meanwhile, the back end, or server process,
or daemon (call it what you will) checks every five seconds to see if
there is a new request in the queue. If there is then it stops checking
the queue and starts generating that request. When finished, it adds the
completed image to the storage area and then resumes its
every-five-seconds check. This approach entirely solves the worry of too
much traffic; if a thousand people all generate an image at once then a
thousand image requests go into the queue (which is not intensive) and
then the back end just processes them one by one. This leaves all the
people near the end of our thousand waiting around a lot at Stage 2,
but, critically, they’re not killing the server by doing so. Running a
thousand image generating processes at once would probably leave
everyone waiting nearly as long, and would not incidentally max out the
server while it was doing it. Not good for anyone,&nbsp;that.</p>
<h4>Actually building&nbsp;it</h4>
<p>So, two separate processes: one web-based, one a background daemon. The
web-based process is a very simple sequence of web pages; a good
solution here would be <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>. The server process
needs to have good image-creation capabilities; use whatever language
you feel most comfortable writing real programs in. I chose Python,
which regular readers will not be surprised to hear, and the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a>.</p>
<h4>The back&nbsp;end</h4>
<p>The back end daemon’s simple operation is described above; I’m not going
to go into much detail about how it actually uses
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PIL</span></span> and some TrueType fonts to write the
requested details onto the poster image. You can <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/conposter/daemon/posterd.py.html">browse the source for the daemon file posterd.py</a> if you’re interested in&nbsp;that.</p>
<h4>The front&nbsp;end</h4>
<p>Since I was using <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, something I don’t do
all that often, this seemed a good opportunity to check out the idea of
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/06/06/templating" title="why you should use templates, or maybe not">using templates to make <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages</a> by
using <a href="http://smarty.php.net/" title="Smarty seems to be the most popular template engine, and it wasn't worth reviewing all existing ones for a project this simple">the Smarty template engine</a> for the&nbsp;project.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;pages</h4>
<p></p>
The front end is composed of three stages, as shown in the diagram; the
stages correspond to three <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> files:
<strong>index.php</strong>, <strong>waitpage.php</strong>, and <strong>display.php</strong>. The design is
conceptually like that shown in the diagram, but in implementation it
ended up slightly differently, because of a technique I tend to use for
multi-page processes on the web. Imagine the simplest of these
processes: ask the user for some data in a form, save the data in a
database, and then display a thankyou message. Some people would have a
two page process as follows: page1 contains the form, which submits to
page2; Page2 saves the data and then displays the message. I don’t do it
like that; I have the form on page1 submit <strong>to</strong> page1, and page1 is
structured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if data has been submitted
  save the data in the database
  redirect to page 2
  end page
end if

display the form
</pre></div>


<p>So, in actuality, the “add a request for image generation” part is done
in page1, and page2 doesn’t do anything but go round and round the
refresh loop until the daemon has completed the&nbsp;request.</p>
<h4>Smarty</h4>
<p>Smarty made this process really, really easy. The way it works, for
those of you not familiar with it, maps very neatly onto simple projects
like this, because it helps the pages separate out. The actual
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> page that the user visits (take index.php,
Stage 1, as an example) <em>just contains page logic</em>. It doesn’t contain
any <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> at all. This means that, basically,
it looks exactly like the pseudocode I outlined above; it’s about ten
lines of code. The <code>display the form</code> bit actually reads
<code>$smarty-&gt;display('frontpage.tpl');</code>, which picks up <code>frontpage.tpl</code>, a
plain <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> file, and displays it. This means
that your <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> template files, <code>*.tpl</code>, look
like <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>, and aren’t cluttered with code.
Meanwhile, your <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> files look like
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span>, and aren’t cluttered up with
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>. This separation is fantastic. On more
complicated projects it’s less easy, because you end up having to create
little blocks of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> in the
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> code ready to be substituted into the
template, and that’s not good, but for a simple project like this it was
a real boon to&nbsp;use.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>There’s lots more I could write about this, like how I make sure the
daemon stays running, and how I clear out old generated images, and how
index.php randomly picks a font and substitutes it into the template,
and how everything to do with the queue (adding new requests, seeing if
a request is completed, <em>ad nauseam</em>) is separated out into a small
library that other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PHP</span></span> code (in index.php,
waitpage.php, etc) can call, but I think I’ll stop here. The point is
that tiny projects like my poster creator give you a chance to try out
these techniques; it’s all too common to think that, well, this is a
quick knock-off application, so I won’t bother to apply technique to it,
I’ll just code from the hip without structure. But then when you come to
do a real proper project, applying the techniques is complicated and
awful and so you don’t do it then either, because you’re not really sure
how. Hone your skills and your approach by doing all this complex stuff
on projects that don’t really need it (for example, the Generator has a
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/wiki/Conservativesposter">spec</a> (albeit a pretty simple one)), so that when you <em>do</em> need it
you’ll be comfortable and confident with the&nbsp;techniques.</p>
