			<p>Schwuk complains that <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/03/21/just">my snarky note on not using .NET</a> is unfair, as
<a href="http://schwuk.com/entries/86/holding-out-for-a-hero">I’m blaming the tools and not the person wielding them</a>. I did
actually ask Schwuk by mail whether he felt that <a href="http://codingslave.blogspot.com/2005/03/q-whos-new-hero.html">the original story</a>
came about because:</p>
<ol>
<li>the JavaScript/ASP/DOM guy is a very good coder</li>
<li>the VS.NET guy is not all that good a coder</li>
<li>JS/ASP/DOM is a better environment than VS.NET/ASP.NET</li>
<li>something else</li>
</ol>
<p>but we’ll continue the discussion here, I think.</p>
<p>Frankly, I do blame the tools rather than the person wielding them. This
isn’t specifically a criticism of VS.NET, but of overarching programming
environments in general, and shades back into the “do we need an
<span class="caps">IDE</span>” debate on which <a href="http://schwuk.com/entries/55/">Schwuk and I have commented previously</a>. I am almost wholly convinced that big
<span class="caps">IDE</span> environments and so forth are actually
constrictive, and only make you more productive if you’re doing
something that the environment designers anticipated you doing; as soon
as you step off that beaten track you become a lot <strong>less</strong> productive.
For example, knocking up a quick few-buttons application in VB is very
fast indeed; much faster than doing it some other way. However, if you
try and do complex things, I find that Python+Gtk+<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~sandino/python-glade/">Sandino’s script</a>
is a much faster environment than contorting VB to do it. Now, you can
accuse me of being no good at VB here, and blame me rather than the
tool…and I won’t argue with your conclusion too much. Maybe I am just a
bad coder. But you have to ask yourself: if VS.NET and
<span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET are good things and make you work
better, why is the other guy not using them?</p>
<p>I think that Schwuk’s comment that “Bob is (probably) used to
developing larger scale applications and hence much more likely to be
bogged down with all the trappings that come with such projects:
requirements, reviews etc” is pretty unreasonable; that suggests that
the reason that Bob can’t write stuff as fast as Frank is that Bob does
lots of “proper” project stuff and Frank just isn’t bothering. Now, I
doubt that that’s what Schwuk meant, but that’s how I read that comment,
and it seems a bit unfair. It’s entirely possible that all Bob’s .NET
trappings aren’t actually making him any more productive.<br>
On the last hand, it’s also possible that Bob, while being less
productive, is producing <em>better</em> code and that’s down to his use of a
more modern environment. Frank might be faster because he’s not doing
certain things (because they’re too difficult), while Bob is doing all
that and more besides (because .NET makes it easy for him). Difficult to
say. But just because Microsoft and <a href="http://www.legaltechnology.org/digital/html/2005/ltinet173.html#story6">lots of third-party suppliers talk about how .NET will make coding easier or better</a> doesn’t actually
make it the case. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people find it
so and some do not; quite probably that’s the case with Bob and Frank,
which just makes it one more meaningless example for me to throw at
Schwuk; no doubt tomorrow he will be able to find a mirror-image example
to throw back at me. This is why conversations are fun, I say. :)</p>
