			<p>I’m a fan of <a href="http://www.chesterton.org/">G. K. Chesterton</a>. Not just his books, but his essays,
his poetry, (to some extent) his philosophy and politics, and the way he
lived his life. Of all his great works (<em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em> being
high on the list) the best, I think, is a short essay he wrote and
published in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8092">Tremendous Trifles</a> in 1909 called <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/writings/policemen">Some Policemen and a Moral</a>. Thanks to the wonder that is things going out of copyright and
the Herculean efforts of <a href="http://www.promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a> I can republish it here
for you to enjoy, and I have done so because you need to read it. It’s
very short, so it won’t take you long. In amongst Chesterton’s
characteristic, and glorious, baroque verbosity and fanciful images
(there lies within a tree which “may reflect with a dark pride that it
was wounded by a gentleman connected with the Liberal press“), lieth
also a message (as the title may have made obvious). I imagine that most
of the readers of this site will agree with the sentiments expressed
therein. A snippet here, which is like movie trailers in that it shows
you the best bits before you start and so the rest may seem a pale
filler between that already seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was certainly accused of something which was either an offence or
was not. I was let off because I proved I was a guest at a big house.
The inference seems painfully clear; either it is not a proof of
infamy to throw a knife about in a lonely wood, or else it is a proof
of innocence to know a rich man. Suppose a very poor person, poorer
even than a journalist, a navvy or unskilled labourer, tramping in
search of work, often changing his lodgings, often, perhaps, failing
in his rent. Suppose he had been intoxicated with the green gaiety of
the ancient wood. Suppose he had thrown knives at trees and could give
no description of a dwelling-place except that he had been fired out
of the last. As I walked home through a cloudy and purple twilight I
wondered how he would have got on.</p>
