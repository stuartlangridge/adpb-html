			<p>Lots of stuff circling over Heathrow. I am pretty much coming to the
conclusion that I should write about ideas that I have rather than
stashing them away in the black hole that is <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/wiki/Projects">my projects list</a>,
because otherwise they'll never get done. I don't like doing that; I'm
pretty firmly of the opinion that if you think a thing would be good
then you should just write it rather than just writing about it; Ade
would say that I do that all the time, because I write specs rather than
writing code, but I try fairly hard to not do so. Nonetheless, these
ideas should live somewhere other than my head, I think. So some posts
should be forthcoming about stuff that's on my mind. Before that,
though, a few notes on random cool things I know about. Telewest, my
cable provider, have launched a new service called <a href="http://www.telewest.co.uk/html/television/teleport/whatis.htm">Teleport</a>. It's
very cool indeed. It's, in fact, the long-promised <em>a la carte</em> TV: you
can watch programmes whenever you want, rather than when they're on. At
first, it seemed a bit rubbish: they have a Teleport Films section where
you can purchase a film for watching. Now, Telewest already had that
with Front Row (now rebranded FilmFlex), but Teleport Films also
contains films that aren't the latest releases; we watched Tango and
Cash the other day. After buying a film you can watch it as many times
as you like within 24 hours, which is faintly cool. Nonetheless, that's
not all that exciting. We then discovered Teleport TV, which is (again)
not all that revolutionary: you can pick TV programmes and watch them,
from a pretty limited list. Most of the programmes are rubbish and stuff
you wouldn't want to watch anyway: one exception is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/wakingthedead/">Waking the Dead</a>,
a BBC murder drama which we've started watching and all three series of
which are available with Teleport TV. So, again, that's faintly cool,
but the selection's not up to much. Then we discovered that it has
TiVo-like properties of being able to pause and rewind and fast-forward
the programmes via the remote control, which was invaluably helpful when
Sam and I look at one anotherand say "what did he just say?" or when we
want to skip the credits on something. Finally, I discovered Teleport
Replay, which has loads of programmes that were on over the last seven
days also available for watching (which go away after those 7 days, much
like the BBC Radio "Listen Again" service). Including Top Gear, which I
shall now never miss again. Well done Telewest. This is a pretty darn
good service, although I'd like to see more programmes available for
Teleport TV, and the user interface is, as usual for Telewest, dog slow.
Nonetheless, nice one. Jono and I moved all the remaining sites from the
old version of our server to the new version. Creating each site was
pretty easy. For those unsure about how to use Apache2, a very short
HOWTO. To create a site www.example.com, I do it like this (either as
root, or using sudo for each command):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">mkdir</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">mkdir</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">html</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(place all files for the site in /var/www/example.com/html)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">chmod</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">rx</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">html</span>
<span class="n">chown</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">R</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">username</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">var</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(use username that should own the site in line above)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
nano example.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>(place the following in the example.com file you're editing)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;VirtualHost</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">*</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

ServerName<span class="w"> </span>www.example.com

ServerAlias<span class="w"> </span>example.com

<span class="nt">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(now back to the prompt)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ln -s ../sites-available/example.com .
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</code></pre></div>

<p>(and that site should now be working) David Morley on the Wolves LUG
list is putting together some video tutorials about how to use Linux
from a newbie's perspective. I'd like to see this: I <a href="http://mailman.lug.org.uk/pipermail/wolves/2005-November/018160.html">wrote some instructions on how to use vnc2swf for recording a video tutorial</a>
(and see the remainder of the thread for corrections). Now, there
already is a tool to do this: Gnome's <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. It's got a good UI
in principle; starting it drops a "record" icon on your panel. Click the
icon to start recording, click it again to stop recording. It outputs to
Ogg Theora. I think the UI could be improved a bit, though; for one, it
should record screencasts and save them as Screencast1, Screencast2,
etc, on your desktop, rather than making you specify a name (as the
Gnome screenshot tool does). At some point I'd like to hack on it to
make that possible, but this is one of those "don't have enough time"
projects. I'd also like to see it be able to output to Flash, as does
vnc2swf. However, I don't want to do that until I've confirmed for
myself that the GPLFlash project can play such created videos. Being
able to just drop Flash stuff on a web page is something of a bonus for
stuff like this; I don't really like in-browser video plugins, mainly
because they never seem to work right for me. We put up our (first)
Christmas tree yesterday. Niamh really likes putting up Christmas
decorations. It does rather amaze me that it's come upon us so fast,
but, hey, we like Christmas. The second tree will be forthcoming once
the new flooring is down in the library, which doesn't happen until
about the 22nd December or something, so bah humbug to that! Anyone want
to buy a piano, by the way? We've run out of room for it. Random
linkage, from Bloglines' Keep New. Incidentally, has anyone else noticed
that Bloglines is getting a bit more shit recently? Slower, down a bit
more, behaving a bit more oddly? People seem to be moving to personal
installations of Gregarius, which I might do.</p>

<li>Quim Gil is <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-web-list/2005-November/msg00026.html">talking about an events.gnome.org site</a>. We need to

<li>Drew's <a href="http://24ways.org/">24 ways to impress your friends</a>, a web development advent
