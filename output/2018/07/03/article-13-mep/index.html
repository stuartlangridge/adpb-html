		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Dear&nbsp;Siôn,</p>
<p>Thank you for your <a href="https://twitter.com/sionsimon/status/1014060437585920000">comments on Twitter</a> welcoming my feedback on the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593"><span class="caps">EU</span>&#8217;s proposed copyright reform</a>. I&#8217;d like to discuss in particular Article 13, &#8220;Use of protected content by information society service providers storing and giving access to large amounts of works and other subject-matter uploaded by their&nbsp;users&#8221;.</p>
<p>Firstly I should say that I am in general in favour of the <span class="caps">EU</span>&#8217;s overall approach to data collection and privacy, and of the goal of copyright reform. I am also in favour of the goals of Article 13: improving the rights of creators over giant American tech companies (and there was a great <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/how-the-eu-can-make-the-internet-play-fair-with-musicians">recent letter in the Guardian</a> on this point). My concerns with Article 13 are not with what it&#8217;s <em>trying</em> to do, but in the implementation: it is loosely worded to the point where it will cause serious problems, it materially underweights the costs and hassle of compliance, and it pushes for unreliable technology without requiring any&nbsp;oversight. </p>
<p>I should unpack those assertions a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<p>Content <span class="caps">ID</span>, the approach of using technology to detect copyrighted material, doesn&#8217;t work very well. Or, more accurately, it&#8217;s way too easy for rightsholders to incorrectly assert rights and it&#8217;s way too hard to appeal because an algorithm doesn&#8217;t listen to explanations. I&#8217;ve experienced this myself: in 2012 myself and my dad <a href="https://kryogenix.org/days/2012/04/09/potton-in-2012-a-video-drivearound/">drove around our home town and videoed all the streets</a> to provide a historical artifact that people could look at thirty years from now to know what the town was like. I found a piece of &#8220;elevator music&#8221;, available under a Creative Commons licence, attached that to the video, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqzB7hf88GA">uploaded it to YouTube</a>. And then later <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/05/30/disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim/">I received a copyright claim from a record company stating that I&#8217;d used music from their catalogue</a>. To be clear here: I had not. They had misidentified the music as being another song, one over which they hold rights. But to explain this I have to file a &#8220;counterclaim&#8221;, hand over my home address, think about naming a solicitor&#8230; or if I don&#8217;t do that, Google put a &#8220;copyright strike&#8221; on my account and start removing my ability to earn money from a thing I made. In this&#8230; I&#8217;m a creator. And I&#8217;m being forced away from my creation. It&#8217;s a small example, but it&#8217;s characteristic: laws designed to protect creators (which, again, I&#8217;m in favour of) need to ensure that they protect the rights of <em>all</em> creators, not just the ones who have a legal department and millions in the bank to fund an indiscriminate barrage of automated takedown requests, especially when those takedown requests are <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>But even if we assume that the technology is 100% reliable (ha! have you ever seen technology that was?), the wording of Article 13 is still problematic. Essentially it says &#8220;if you allow people to upload things, you need to implement Content <span class="caps">ID</span> now&#8221;. The text refers to those who store and provide &#8220;large&#8221; amounts of works, but in no way define what that actually is! I run a <a href="http://community.badvoltage.org">discussion forum</a> for <a href="http://badvoltage.org">a podcast</a>, and there people can post messages and, importantly, also post files. Are we hosting a &#8220;large&#8221; amount of works? I doubt it, but&#8230; who knows? And how do I implement Content <span class="caps">ID</span> anyway? In order to tell whether an uploaded thing is copyrighted I&#8217;d need access to every copyrighted work ever; this inevitably means that I&#8217;d need to subscribe to some sort of &#8220;is this thing copyrighted?&#8221; third-party service, which will not at all be free of charge and would be a burden to integrate even if it were. This is a major pain to do, and it essentially applies to everyone because it&#8217;s not at all clear where the dividing line is for &#8220;you are now big enough to have to do&nbsp;this&#8221;.</p>
<p>I get the goal of this. I <em>sympathise</em> with the goal of this. It&#8217;s to say: hey, huge hosting sites, YouTube et al, you have to try harder to stop people uploading music and movies without ensuring that the creators get paid. You can&#8217;t hide behind the excuse that it&#8217;s up to the uploader to check and you&#8217;re just a neutral repository; you bear some responsibility here, so get on with it. I think that is correct and proper! And I also sympathise with the idea that defining &#8220;huge hosting sites, YouTube et al&#8221; in actual legal terms is pretty difficult. But the current wording is a poor attempt at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like&#8230; well, imagine that we were worried about stabbing incidents in nightclubs, and so we want to pass a law saying that everyone going into a club needs to be searched to ensure that they don&#8217;t have a knife. But the law says &#8220;all persons entering a place of assembly with music must be searched&#8221;, and then someone who runs a coffee shop on the High Street says &#8220;hey, surely I don&#8217;t have to search everyone who comes in to buy a latte, do I?&#8221;. And they do, because the description probably applies to them too&#8230; and now they&#8217;re turning customers away because they don&#8217;t want to be searched in order to buy a cup of tea. The goal of the law is a good idea; the intentions behind it are worthwhile. But it&#8217;s drafted in a way that pulls in a whole load of people that it&#8217;s not aimed at, and fills those people with uncertainty and concern. If you&#8217;re a multinational corporation then licensing some sort of Content <span class="caps">ID</span> service is just one more cost on the balance sheet. If you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s a huge deal. Just the uncertainty of <em>whether</em> you might be on the list is a huge&nbsp;deal.</p>
<p>And saying &#8220;you probably don&#8217;t count as &#8216;large&#8217;, so don&#8217;t worry about it; we promise to only prosecute those people who deserve it&#8221; is not at all encouraging. Especially if you&#8217;re a small host and the people who&#8217;ve decided to sue are a huge media company whose software has misidentified your theme tune as one of their records. There&#8217;s a huge incentive for content owners to threaten small hosts under this law, and it&#8217;s really hard to fight back against that; if I get a letter saying &#8220;you are a host distributing content without having a content scanning policy as per Article 13&#8221; then I can&#8217;t afford to even <em>argue</em> about that; anything involving the courts is in itself expensive and time-consuming. I&#8217;m not going to instruct a solicitor to help with that case, at a hundred pounds an hour; I&#8217;m going to shut my forum down. And this applies even if that letter I received was sent by an algorithm which misidentified some music and no human ever saw it. If I can say &#8220;that law doesn&#8217;t apply to me&#8221;, then I&#8217;m good. If I can only say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it applies&#8221;&#8230; then I&#8217;m&nbsp;sunk.</p>
<p>Smaller hosts and creators are not, and really mustn&#8217;t become, necessary fallout in a fight between big content creation firms and big internet companies. Please don&#8217;t let this law go forward in the way it&#8217;s currently written; have it do the job it&#8217;s intended to and not&nbsp;more. </p>
<p>Many thanks for taking the time to read all this. I look forward to your response, and to have further discussion about it all. I&#8217;ve posted this letter to my website as well so that it might help others also looking to contact their representatives; I&#8217;d be happy to update that with your thoughts as well (or not, of course, if you prefer&nbsp;not).</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Stuart&nbsp;Langridge</p>
