			<p>I've just released <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/episodes/103">episode 20 of season 5 of LugRadio</a>, which is
always a fun process (remind me to write about the actual release
process for these things at some point; after over a hundred shows I'm
starting to nail down precisely how to publish a show in four formats
and to ten mirrors with the minimum of effort!). It was a pretty fun
show to record, and recording it reminded me that I haven't written much
about this year's <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/UK2008/">LugRadio Live UK</a>. Now, there are going to be some
of you reading this who already listen to LugRadio and who therefore
know about it: this post is for the rest of you (well, mainly those of
you in the UK or in close-ish parts of Europe). If you do know about
LugRadio Live UK already, then you should go and <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/LugRadio_Live_UK_2008_19_20_July_Wolverhampton">digg it</a> and post
one of the <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1191">LRL UK buttons</a> to your blog. If not...read on! Basically,
it's gonna be brilliant. This is the fourth year of LugRadio Live in the
UK -- we did the live event in the US as well for the first time in
April this year, and it was <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22lugradio+live%22+%22san+francisco%22">pretty damned cool</a> -- and we're really
looking forward to it. It's always a jolly good laugh putting together
LRL; looking through people's speaker submissions (if you submitted a
paper, I'll be sending you details of when you're speaking or whether
you weren't accepted in the next few days, I promise), thinking up cool
stuff to do, and planning the live show. This year, I'm really looking
forward to seeing <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/speakers">the speaker lineup</a> -- we've got some ultra-cool
people talking about technology and culture and open source, and we've
got some ultra-cool people exhibiting their projects and their products
and their companies as well. The thing that really gets me about LRL
every year is the vibe -- we got described as a "rock conference" a
couple of years ago, and it really summed up the feel of the whole event
for me. It's about having a laugh. We originally set up LugRadio Live
because the fun bit at all the other conferences was the evening when
you hung out with a bunch of cool people and had a beer and chatted
about everything -- our thought was, why can't we just take that
feeling, that experience, and make a whole weekend out of it? And lo and
behold, that's what we've done for four years now, which I'm really
quite proud of! Enough of why you should come and of back-slapping. How
can you be part of LRL? It's in Wolverhampton on Saturday the 19th and
Sunday 20th July (see the <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/travel">travel info</a> for how to get to the venue).
We've got deals with local hotels, too -- LRL is a true grassroots event
(that's why it's five quid for a two day conference), so we don't want
to make it expensive, because people pay themselves. Your company
probably won't send you to LugRadio Live...but they should. You'll find
out more there than in a month of listening to people in suits. :)
Anyway, come to LRL and be part of it. You can <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/LugRadio_Live_UK_2008_19_20_July_Wolverhampton">digg it</a>, but more
importantly tell your friends that you're coming and get them to come
too! You can pick one of the <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1191">I'm coming to LugRadio Live buttons</a> to put on your site, or <a href="http://lugradio.atchoo.org/badge.php">design your own custom button</a> if
you don't like ours! So...get involved! See you in July!</p>
