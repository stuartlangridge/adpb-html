		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I've been a big fan of Tilda, the dropdown terminal window for Linux,
for a long while; pressing F2 to grab a terminal is hardwired into my
fingers now, and I'm crippled without it. However, Tilda's been getting
steadily shitter as time's gone on; more crashy, more unresponsive.
Recently, it stopped taking keyboard focus when you brought it up, which
has led more than once to me pressing F2 and then typing half the shell
command I wanted into my (still focused) Firefox window. Not only is
this incredibly annoying, but at some point I'm going to type my
password into an IRC channel. It's gotta stop. The obvious replacement
is yakuake, the KDE dropdown terminal. However, I hate it. I don't even
know why, to be honest; it just feels weird to me in a way that Tilda
doesn't. So I looked around for alternatives, and found two: Guake,
which is supposedly a better Tilda and Yakuake for the Gnome desktop,
and yeahconsole. Sadly for the Guake team, I found yeahconsole first, so
that's what I'm using. Actually, I rather like the out-and-out
simplicity and bare-bones nature of yeahconsole, which is why I'm
sticking with it; when I need to do shell things, I don't want flashy
features, I want a shell. I don't use tabbed terminal windows, for
example. Just simplicity, that's what I want. Yeahconsole is available
in the Ubuntu repositories (<a href="apt:yeahconsole">click to install on Ubuntu</a>). Here's how
I set it up. First, it needs to run every time I log in. So, go to
<strong>System &gt; Preferences &gt; Session</strong>, select <strong>Startup Programs</strong>, click
<strong>Add</strong>, and add a new command, name "YeahConsole", command
"yeahconsole". Next, it looks a bit rubbish when you start it up. Here's
how bare-bones yeahconsole is: you configure it with X resources. Party
like it's 1989! I had to go look up how to do this; for the more tender
in years among us, X resources were a sort of central configuration for
all your apps, round about the same time that humanity was fighting off
sabre-toothed tigers and wondering whether that hot flamey thing in the
corner could actually be useful. On Ubuntu, you need to edit (actually,
you probably need to <em>create</em>) a file called <code>.Xresources</code> in your home
folder<span style="color: red" title="And on Debian. On other distros it might be called .Xdefaults">*</span>.
In that file, you put the configuration for yeahconsole, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>yeahconsole*toggleKey: None+F2
yeahconsole*consoleHeight: 20
yeahconsole*aniDelay: 0
yeahconsole*stepSize: 10
yeahconsole*faceName: ProFontWindows:style=Regular
yeahconsole*faceSize: 9
</code></pre></div>

<p>The toggleKey one is the important one: it sets which key you use to
summon the terminal. I like F2, myself, but pick whatever. What all this
stuff means is documented in the man page (<a href="man:yeahconsole">man yeahconsole</a>), apart
from which font to use. This is the faceName and faceSize options above,
and here you have to delve a bit (I told you this was old-fashioned; I
started writing a yeahconsole-properties configuration utility that did
all this for you, but couldn't be bothered). In a terminal, run
<code>fc-list</code>. This lists all the TrueType fonts that you can use in an
xterm. Choose one, and put it in faceName above. Now, simply start
yeahconsole for the first time (press Alt+F2, type <code>yeahconsole</code>), and
then press F2 (or your key of choice). Pow, a dropdown terminal, like
Tilda, but one that won't keep crashing and make you cry. One other
thing: if you hit Ctrl-D to log out by mistake, it'll close yeahconsole
(tilda did this too), and that's really irritating. To fix this, put the
following in a file called <code>bashloop</code> in your home folder:</p>
<div class="highlight"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span>true<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span>bash<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>and change your Startup Programs command above to be
<code>yeahconsole -e /home/username/bashloop</code>. Now Ctrl-D won't close
yeahconsole. Win.</p>
