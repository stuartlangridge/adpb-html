			<p>Jeremy Keith <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1398">writes about where the fault lies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I’m on the tube listening to my iPod—because, y’know, that’s
exactly the kind of situation for which the iPod was invented—and
somebody steals said iPod, which is illegal, is that my fault? If I
publish my email address online—because, y’know, I actually want
people to be able to get in touch with me quickly and conveniently—and
it gets harvested by scum-sucking spammers who send unsolicted
commercial email, which is illegal, is that my fault? If I utter my
date of birth or my mother’s maiden name—because, y’know, I don’t
believe that information should be a state secret—and somebody uses
that information to “steal my identity”, which is illegal, is that my
fault?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. None of those things are your fault. In a similar way, another
Jeremy, Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">published his bank details in a newspaper in an attempt to prove that the furore over the UK government losing the personal data of 25 million people was a storm in a teacup</a>. Of course, someone used those details to set up a £500
direct debit to a diabetes charity, so he's now a monkey out of pocket.
That act is basically theft; theft is illegal. Was that Clarkson's
fault? No, not really. He wasn't at fault. What he was was imprudent,
deeply so. (And deservedly so, I feel. Clarkson is one of my favourite
presenters, and I have boundless respect for his knowledge of cars and
engineering and his personal style; he knows a round brown fuck-all
about technology, though.) Look, it works like this. If you believe that
the world should be open (which I do), then you can't insist that if
someone takes advantage of that openness, it's Someone Else's Problem.
It's your problem if they take advantage of your data. If you want to be
open, to publish, to break down barriers that stop us properly
communicating, then that's a great idea... but each person then becomes
individually responsible for their own security. On the other hand, if
you want someone else to make the hard decisions for you, to accept
liability and take responsibility for problems, to protect you so you
can go about your life unscathed, then that someone else gets to make
the decisions about what you do with your data, and you don't. If you
ask your bank "should I publish all my bank details online?", they'll
say: no, don't do that. If you ask the police "should I leave my iPod
visible on the tube?", they'll say: no, don't do that (and that's what
the "byepod" posters are all about). If it's the police's responsibility
to keep your iPod safe (by tracking down criminals who steal it) then
they get to have some measure of control over what you do with it. If
you demand the ability to do what you like with your stuff, then you
have to take on some of the responsibility for protecting it. It can't
work both ways; you can't have all the benefits of openness (I can
publish my email address where I like!) and none of the deficits
(someone else must solve my spam problem!). With great power comes great
responsibility, as Uncle Ben tells us. It's not about blame, it's about
prudence. It's not about taking decisions out of fear, it's about taking
responsibility for life. We're all grown-ups now. No more hiding under
the bedclothes and letting Daddy protect you from the big bad world.</p>
