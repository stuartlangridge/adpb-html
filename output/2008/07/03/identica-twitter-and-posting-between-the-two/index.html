			<p>It's now the trendy thing to write an essay about why Twitter is doomed,
or why it's not doomed and all its competitors are doomed instead. And
god knows I wouldn't want to break the back of that trend. I've been
playing with <a href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca</a>, a Twitter clone written in PHP. Lots of
Twitter people are becoming frustrated with seeing the famous Fail Whale
on Twitter's "we are currently down" page, and people are starting to
look elsewhere. There are lots (and lots and lots) of alterni-Twitters
(which is a problem I'll come back to in a moment), but identi.ca is
attracting one of the communities I operate in, open source people. This
is because identi.ca is entirely open source: the codebase is called
<a href="http://laconi.ca/">Laconica</a>. This is a nice idea. First things first, though: I don't
want to update two places at once.
Identica<span style="color:red" title="It's not clear whether it's called Identica or Identi.ca">*</span>
doesn't have an API (yet), but I wanted to post things to Twitter and
have them appear on Identica too. So, I present the Twitter Identi.ca
Reflector. <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/twitter-identica.tar.gz">Download as a tarball</a> or <a href="http://svn.kryogenix.org/svn/twitter-identica">check it out from Subversion</a>
or <a href="http://svn.kryogenix.org/listing.php?repname=kryogenix.org&amp;path=%2Ftwitter-identica%2F&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0">browse the source</a>. The <a href="http://svn.kryogenix.org/svn/twitter-identica/README">README</a> tells you how to set it up. It
uses Jabber to post to Identica, which isn't ideal, but (as mentioned)
there's no API. So now you can send Twitter posts to Identi.ca, which is
helpful. Now, why Twitter is good, why Identi.ca is good, and why
everything else isn't. If you just wanted to post Twitter comments to
Identi.ca then you can stop reading now. Twitter looks like it ought to
be easy to clone, and it isn't. This is why there are lots of Twitter
clones, and why none of them have taken off. The basic principle of
microblogging is indeed an easy one, I agree. But all the other
Twitter-alikes are missing something. They don't have SMS sending, or
SMS following, or they don't have an API, or they don't have lots of
desktop clients, or they have one desktop client that doesn't run on
everyone's machine, or they don't do IM. What makes Twitter good is two
things: the first is that you can get at it in <em>so many ways</em>. And
because there are so many ways, people can build lots of things on top
of it. For example, if you want to do the reverse of what the above
reflector does (post your messages to Identi.ca and have them show up on
Twitter) then you don't need an extra program, because it already
exists: <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">Twitterfeed</a>. Simply sign up at Twitterfeed, and use it to
send posts from your Identica feed to Twitter, and it's all done. That's
the power of having an expressive and complete set of APIs. It can't be
underestimated. The second reason Twitter is good is that everyone's
already there. They got first-mover advantage. There's no point going to
an alternative because <em>none of your friends are there</em>. This is also
the reason that Twitter has fifty desktop clients and that things like
Twitterfeed exist; it's worth the investment. It does mean that if
people leave Twitter they'll all leave together and the bottom drops out
of their market, but that's the way the internet cookie crumbles. Photo
sharing sites have the same issue -- it's difficult to build a Flickr
competitor because everyone's already at Flickr, so none of the "social"
stuff happens elsewhere because you never hit a critical mass of people.
So, what's good about Identi.ca then? Well, for me, the big things are
open-sourceness and federation. The underlying codebase being open
source is a huge win, from my perspective. It means people other than
the Identi.ca team can work on adding new features, it means that we can
see what's going on, and it means that there are more open source
programs in the world. I like this. Other people may not, but what the
hell. The other advantage is federation. This is all about the
<a href="http://www.openmicroblogging.org/">OpenMicroBlogging</a> specification; it basically blows away the "all my
friends are at Twitter so I must be too" point. It means that you can
subscribe on one microblogging service to people <em>on other microblogging
services</em>. I could be at Identi.ca, you could be at Twitter, someone
else could be at Jaiku or Pownce or wherever else, and we all read one
another's messages, happy as Larry. It levels the playing field. I can
subscribe Identi.ca to Twitter without problems. This is a great idea
which is rather hampered by the fact that basically no-one has
implemented it yet. It's in Laconica, though, so Identica has it. It
helps get around the scaling problems that Twitter are having, too: you
don't need one centralised Twitter service any more. There can be lots
of little islands, all of which talk to one another. No more scaling
problems. No more Fail Whale. People who need the extras that Twitter
provides can use Twitter quite happily (as I'm doing; I like SMS!),
people who don't need that but do need other services can use something
else that provides those other services. The basic concept of
microblogging has been commoditised thanks to <a href="http://www.openmicroblogging.org">OpenMicroBlogging</a> --
it's become a simple thing to implement anywhere. Microblogging services
can now compete on which extras they offer. That's why I like Identi.ca.
Oh, and they let you create your account with OpenID, which I did. It's
a win all round. Development's going on at a fast pace on the Laconica
codebase, so expect to see more and more appear over there. Blizzard's
already added identi.ca support to <a href="http://whoisi.com">Whoisi</a>, so things are moving
quickly. I don't know whether the trickle of Twitterites in Identi.ca's
direction will continue, but thanks to the reflector code above, I'm now
on Identi.ca without putting in any extra effort. That's
<a href="http://identi.ca/sil">identi.ca/sil</a> for those of you who want to track it.</p>
