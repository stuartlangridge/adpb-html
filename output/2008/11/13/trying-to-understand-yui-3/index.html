		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been looking at <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/"><span class="caps">YUI</span> 3</a>, because I ought to know about it and I
currently don&#8217;t. I used <span class="caps">YUI</span> 2 for a few things and found myself
perpetually frustrated with the documentation and the general feel of
it, but I figured that maybe that was just me. (Disclosure: I&#8217;m a jQuery
guy. Use it for everything. So I&#8217;m biased, right out of the gate.)
Anyway, my frustration with the <span class="caps">YUI</span> documentation doesn&#8217;t seem to have
been alleviated in version 3. This is a case study in how someone new to
the <span class="caps">YUI</span> 3 library sees the documentation. (Well, it&#8217;s really a set of
stream-of-consciousness rants, because that&#8217;s the best way I can think
of getting my sense of confusion and discombobulation across.) The
underlying problem I always had with the <span class="caps">YUI</span> 2 documentation was that
the examples show how to do one specific thing but don&#8217;t explain <em>why</em>
to do it that specific way, and don&#8217;t seem very generalisable to do
other similar things. So they&#8217;re hard to learn from. The reference
manual, on the other hand, is useless. It gives you a textbox and says
&#8220;Start typing to find a property/method/event/config&#8221;. If you already
know what you&#8217;re looking for, if you know which function you want to use
but can&#8217;t remember the order of the parameters that you need to pass to
it, then that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s a dictionary. But you can&#8217;t learn a language
from a dictionary, and you can&#8217;t learn the <span class="caps">YUI</span> from the reference
manual. I hardly ever find myself thinking &#8220;I need to use the
<span class="caps">YUI</span>.Get.script function but I can&#8217;t remember the name of the
parameters&#8221;. Instead, I find myself thinking &#8220;I want to execute a <span class="caps">JSON</span>-P
script; how do I do it?&#8221; Now, the jQuery documentation has a similar
problem, to some extent, but critically it shows you all the functions
in a list, so I can look through them and work out which is likely to be
the one I want. The <span class="caps">YUI</span> does not. The jQuery docs also have inline
executable examples with each function, so I can see working code and
test it. The <span class="caps">YUI</span> reference manual does not. But I shouldn&#8217;t start with
the reference manual. The <span class="caps">YUI</span> docs specifically say to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/#start">, so I did&nbsp;so.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/event/event-simple.html">The very first example</a> is showing how to attach an event
handler to a node. Fine as far as it goes (and I like the idea that you
get passed a full-on event object to your function whether you&#8217;re in a
browser that supports that or not), but&#8230;the code in the example just
drifts in space. It&#8217;s not wrapped in an onDOMContentLoaded or anything.
(I admit it&#8217;s the first example, which means you don&#8217;t want to load
people down with infrastructure just so they can write a click
function.) So, since there&#8217;s a working example in the page, I looked in
the source myself, and we&nbsp;get</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">YUI</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">combine</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="p">}).</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;node&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="p">...</span> <span class="nx">code</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">example</span><span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ah, <span class="caps">OK</span>, so that&#8217;s onDOMContentLoaded, is it? a new <span class="caps">YUI</span> function. I&#8217;m
sure it&#8217;ll be explained later. Moving on, the next example explains
onAvailable, onContentReady, and event:ready &#8212; three different &#8220;is the
thing ready for me to use&#8221; load events. (All of which make sense at
different times, and are potentially useful.) That&#8217;s all good, but&#8230;the
previous example, even after I&#8217;d looked in the code, didn&#8217;t use any of
them! How did that work? Ah, a feeling of doom creeps over me. More
disclosure: I really, really don&#8217;t like the Yahoo practice of putting
your <span class="caps">JS</span> inline at the bottom of the page. I think it means that my <span class="caps">JS</span>
isn&#8217;t separated out into different files where it&#8217;s easy to edit, it
makes refactoring the page hard because you have to care exactly where
your script elements are and be careful if you move <span class="caps">HTML</span> elements
around, and it&#8217;s a lot easier to teach people to make their <span class="caps">JS</span>
unobtrusive if you can offer the rule &#8220;Put all your JavaScript in
separate files and don&#8217;t have any anywhere in your <span class="caps">HTML</span>&#8221;. I know there
are good reasons why Yahoo do it, and I accept those reasons. If I build
a site which gets as many hits as they do then I&#8217;ll test both ways and
the extra three milliseconds you get from having the <span class="caps">JS</span> in-page without
DOMContentLoaded may make a big difference. For most of the stuff I
write, though, I don&#8217;t like it and try to not use it. So, the first
example was obviously reliant on that (because it&#8217;s not hooking any load
event at all), but didn&#8217;t say so. Moving on, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/node/basic-node.html">next example I read</a>, about nodes, does the same thing. As far as I can tell, nothing
anywhere in these examples has said &#8220;make sure you put this example code
after the things it&#8217;s referring to&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t do that (say, if you
put it in the head because that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ve been taught that
JavaScript should go) then it plain won&#8217;t work, and you won&#8217;t know why.
(Maybe I missed the 72-point red writing which says this? I hope I did.)
Next example I read (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/node/node-evt-delegation.html">event delegation</a>, a thing I like very much):
doesn&#8217;t show why the clicked items turn green (obviously <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and indeed
it doesn&#8217;t take long to find the link in the source), but also&#8230;when I
click on one of the items and it turns green, there&#8217;s a subtle animation
effect to it, as if the green colour expands out from the centre of the
item. It&#8217;s quite a nice effect. I can&#8217;t for the life of me find what&#8217;s
doing it, though. (Doesn&#8217;t do it in Midori, a webkit browser, so maybe
it&#8217;s Firefox?) I spent ten minutes trying to work out why clicking on an
item sets a class (&#8220;yui-pass&#8221;) on that item and then alters text in all
non-yui-pass items, rather than just using e.target. Of course, the
reason is that a <em>second</em> click on a different item should set that
second item to green and not unset the first green item. Fine and dandy:
a note about that in the example would have helped, though. Yes, the
examples are there to demonstrate <span class="caps">YUI</span>, not to explain how to produce a
specific effect, but&#8230;what people <em>want</em> is a specific effect.
Explaining how it works would help with that. Explaining the <span class="caps">YUI</span> parts
of an example but not putting them in the context of the rest of the
code is like explaining how to build a house with a two-hour lecture on
bricks without ever mentioning that you need mortar to stick them
together. &#8220;The rest of the code&#8221; here is a couple of lines, but the
example would make much more sense if it was all explained. Once I&#8217;d got
this far, I started thinking, hm, hasn&#8217;t changed, still the docs are
written for someone who isn&#8217;t me and I don&#8217;t get them. So I started
dotting around picking and choosing bits to look at rather than going
through step-by-step. One of the features I like most about jQuery is
that I can call a <span class="caps">JSON</span>-P script and still specify my callback function
inline, rather than having to separate it out and give it a name and
pass that name as callback=myCallback to the <span class="caps">JSON</span>-P script. (It gets
given a name under-the-covers by jQuery, of course, so that the callback
does have something to call, but I don&#8217;t have to think about it. I like
inline functions.) It&#8217;s be useful to me if <span class="caps">YUI</span> 3 could do that, so I
thought I&#8217;d have a look to see if it&#8217;s possible. I don&#8217;t <em>think</em> it is,
but&#8230;I can&#8217;t tell. The docs don&#8217;t seem to mention the idea of loading
scripts that call a callback function at all. Instead, I think you&#8217;re
supposed to use <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/api/Get.html#method_script"><span class="caps">YUI</span>.Get.script</a> and read the <span class="caps">JSON</span> out of the nodes
array that you get passed. Perhaps. Here we come back to my problem with
the <span class="caps">YUI</span> docs: I know what I want to do, but not how to do it, and
there&#8217;s no way to answer my question. If there isn&#8217;t an example dealing
with it, I am out of luck. Someone tell me how I ought to be reading the
documentation. Maybe I&#8217;m missing something. But it does rather feel to
me like the docs are reference material: they&#8217;re there for people who
already understand <span class="caps">YUI</span>. The examples are incomplete &#8212; focusing on just
the part you&#8217;re trying to show is understandable, but if the example
won&#8217;t work without the other parts then you have to show the other parts
too! If your example only works if it&#8217;s wrapped with
<code>YUI().use("node"), function(Y) { ... })</code> then you have to show that. If
it only works if it&#8217;s wrapped in DOMContentLoaded, or if it&#8217;s placed at
the bottom of the page in a script element, then you have to say that.
Yes, it&#8217;s a ballache to have to explain how events work and how loading
works and not get to any real concrete examples until chapter 3 or 4 of
your documentation. But <em>people need to know that stuff</em> or your
examples will not work when someone uses them without knowing the&nbsp;context.</p>
