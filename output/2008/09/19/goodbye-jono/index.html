		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>My friend <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/">Jono</a> is going away. I&#8217;d sorta-kinda been involved in the
Linux community before 2000, when I moved to the Midlands, but my
participation was rather sporadic. I was <em>running</em> Linux — had been
since university in &#8216;96 — but I&#8217;d hardly ever managed to make it to a
<span class="caps">LUG</span> meet or talk on mailing lists. When I came over here, to the armpit
of the world that is the greater Birmingham area, I thought to myself:
let&#8217;s give this <span class="caps">LUG</span> thing a try. The closest one to me, technically, is
South Birmingham <span class="caps">LUG</span>, but then as now they&#8217;re pretty unresponsive (as I
write this their website&#8217;s down, for example). Wolverhampton, a place
I&#8217;d only ever heard about on the telly, was the next closest, and so
along I went. Meets in pubs; there were only a few people there, and one
of them was Jono. (Wave, those of you who were around back then! — fizz,
pinkoi,
Ranulph<span title="although he wasn't Ranulph then!" style="color:red">*</span>,
Jon Farmer, the elusive Sparkes.) For a while, he used to drive me back
to Stourbridge after the meetings so I didn&#8217;t have to leave on the
10.30pm bus, before the pub closed. When someone stole my Sharp Zaurus
out of my hand in Wolverhampton, he was the one I called. Came and
looked after me, too, despite me reeling somewhat. At the first and last
Wolves <span class="caps">LUG</span> meeting in my house (in Stourbridge, which is not
Wolverhampton), we set up LugRadio. There&#8217;ve always been four people on
the team, from day one right up until we ended the show this summer, but
the two who were there at the beginning and the end were Jono and me.
It&#8217;s taken us to America, around the <span class="caps">UK</span>, to conferences, into the ears
of two million
people<span style="color:red" title="well, two million downloads; some people may have listened to more than one, I admit">*</span>,
and onto stages and off again. Was a wild ride. The feeling of walking
out on stage and having hundreds of people cheer makes every drug you
can think of slink away with its tail between its legs. We did that. I
remember going out for a Chinese meal, wives and girlfriends in tow, and
the two of us being genuinely unable to stop laughing at the idea of
someone with the name James Hilchin who told a lot of lies. Could not
stop. One of those moments where your sides are hurting and your eyes
are watering and you&#8217;re trying hard to breathe and you can&#8217;t get it
together and <em>it wasn&#8217;t even that funny</em>. It&#8217;s moments like that that
make the world go round. If it&#8217;s not happening to you then you don&#8217;t
have good enough friends. He&#8217;s got a
<span style="background: #ccc; padding: 5px; -moz-border-radius: 3px; -webkit-border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #aaa;">Ctrl</span>
key from an old keyboard, and every now and again he&#8217;ll re-discover it
in a drawer or under a plate of Chinese food or balanced on top of the
tumble dryer, and he&#8217;ll turn to someone and hand them the key and say,
&#8220;I think you need to take control.&#8221; Now the next stage begins: Jono&#8217;s
off to America. It&#8217;s pretty exciting, to be honest. I&#8217;m rather envious
of him — not particularly of being in <em>America</em> per se: I want to be
near my daughter, and, well, the Americans ship people off to Syria and
waterboard
them<span style="color:red" title="yes, yes, I'm not talking about you, gentle reader">*</span>
— but being able to grasp the nettle with both hands. I grasped a nettle
once when I was a kid and I couldn&#8217;t even clench a fist for two weeks.
It seems to work for him, though. Americans: you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gonna
hit you. When I split up with my wife I ended up living in his house for
three months. Barely charged me any rent, either. On the other hand,
have you tried living in a house without a fridge? It&#8217;s not as easy as
it looks, especially if you drink a lot of tea and have to make it with
frigging horrible powdered milk that floats in big lumps like the
Titanic&#8217;s iceberg in your <span class="caps">PG</span> Tips. I could probably stand to not go
through that again, given the choice. George Bernard Shaw, unless it was
Chesterton or someone like that, said that a man&#8217;s friends argue with
him but leave him as he is. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who
think that Jono and I can&#8217;t stand one another because of the volume of
the arguments. We&#8217;ll argue about <em>anything</em>. It&#8217;s really hugely
enjoyable, although not everyone sees it that way. In fact, pretty much
no-one sees it that way, which is probably one of the reasons I enjoy it
so much. Not that mature, but, well, there it is. There&#8217;s a certain
thread of immaturity running through the whole of the last five years
when Bacon and I have been together, I ought to note. In <em>The League of
Gentlemen</em> (in the first episode, I think), there&#8217;s a scene (pretty
famous scene, which is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoczBIIh9hQ">on YouTube</a> like everything else) where a
bewildered policeman stumbles into the local shop to search for a
missing child. Tubbs, the proprietor, tells Edward (her husband) that
&#8220;he&#8217;s looking for a boy&#8221;, and Edward responds with &#8220;Poofter, eh?&#8221; Since
then, every time without exception either of us rings the other, which
is pretty much every day, that&#8217;s the line we open with. I don&#8217;t even
think he likes the show very much. We changed it at one point to
&#8220;Poofter, B?&#8221;, but that wore out when I tried out &#8220;Poofter, ℵ&#8221; (that&#8217;s
an aleph! First character of the Hebrew alphabet!) and then neither knew
what the next letter was. I suppose this is what Wikipedia is for, but
that&#8217;d spoil the fun, you know it would. I&#8217;ve lost track of all the
crises and trials and tribulations we&#8217;ve helped one another through. To
be honest, there&#8217;s probably more going on in the free software world in
San Francisco than there is in the <span class="caps">UK</span> anyway. There&#8217;s certainly more
going on in <span class="caps">SF</span> than in Wolverhampton. It all makes a tolerable amount of
sense: a new chapter, still young and still have the opportunity to do
it. I don&#8217;t think anyone lies there on their deathbed and says, well, I
wish I&#8217;d seen less stuff and spent more time at the office. Jono&#8217;s
repeatedly told me that San Francisco is the birthplace of thrash metal,
like I could give two tugs of a dead dog&#8217;s dick. It&#8217;s the exuberance I
like: he&#8217;s really excited about this, even though no-one he speaks to
cares, because he&#8217;ll be in a place where his heroes walked. If I have a
hero, he&#8217;d be it, I think. Fly well,&nbsp;mate.</p>
