			<p>Ben Darlow <a href="http://stumble.kapowaz.net/post/25792347">accuses Bruce Schneier of spreading <span class="caps">FUD</span> about the iPhone</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t lock-in, it’s called choosing a product that meets your
needs. If you don’t want to be tied to a particular phone network,
don’t buy an iPhone. If installing third-party applications (between
now and the end of February, when officially-sanctioned ones will
start to appear) is critically important to you, don’t buy an iPhone.
It’s one thing to grumble about an otherwise tempting device not
supporting some feature you would find useful; it’s another entirely
to imply that this represents anti-libertarian lock-in. The fact
remains, you are free to buy one of the many other devices on the
market that existed before there ever was an&nbsp;iPhone.
</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben, I&#8217;m not sure how it&#8217;s possible for &#8220;lock-in&#8221; to exist, if that&#8217;s
your necessary condition for it. That&#8217;s got nothing to do with iPhones.
Don&#8217;t like how Microsoft lock you in with Exchange and Outlook? You
should have chosen different mail programs. Don&#8217;t like how you&#8217;ve been
locked into the iTunes Music Store because you&#8217;ve got an iPod? You
should have bought a different music player. Don&#8217;t like how you&#8217;ve been
locked in to anything? Shoulda bought something else, dude. Lock-in
doesn&#8217;t exist. We are never forced to do anything. We have always been
at war with&nbsp;Eurasia.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your iPhone comes with a complicated list of rules about what you
can and can’t do with it. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2008/02/securitymatters_0207">Schneier</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I’ve been looking through the exquisitely arranged packaging that
mine came in and I’m still struggling to find that list! Perhaps it’s
written in black smallprint on the underside of the lid? You know, the
lid that’s&nbsp;black?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, it&#8217;s better than that. It comes with a complicated list of rules
about what you can and can&#8217;t do with it <em>and you&#8217;re not allowed to see the list</em>. For one example: you can use your Bluetooth headset to make
calls but not listen to music. That&#8217;s a rule: I&#8217;d actually prefer it if
it said that on the box, but it doesn&#8217;t. You get to buy it and <em>then</em>
find out that it doesn&#8217;t work, or you get to research all the things you
might want to do online first. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the iPhone&#8217;s a lovely
device; it&#8217;s pleasurable to hold and enjoyable to use, which is not
something you can say about very many bits of electronic equipment at
all. For 90% of the people who want it and don&#8217;t want anything more,
it&#8217;s perfect; it&#8217;ll read their email, browse the web, and make phone
calls. The complaints that people who complain about it have pretty much
boil down to how <em>arbitrary</em>-seeming the restrictions are. What was all
that crap about how iPhone-native apps might overwhelm the cell network,
eh? Since the iPod touch also needs jailbreaking, that was clearly
bullshit. Still, apps are coming, so perhaps that&#8217;ll make it all better.
There are plenty of people who hate the iPhone, and Apple, way more than
they deserve, but there are equally plenty of people who flat-out refuse
to hear a word against the device or anything else that comes out of
Cupertino. If you&#8217;re somewhere in the middle ground on this, like most
people are, and you&#8217;re prepared to put up with the restrictions that
Apple put on you to get the good experience they provide, you go for it.
If you get fucked, then that&#8217;s the way it is, but hey: sometimes being
fucked is nice. That&#8217;s why the human race still exists, after&nbsp;all.</p>
