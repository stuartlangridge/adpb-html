			<p>That git Steve <a href="http://sgchipman.com/blog/?p=51">pokes me with the latest trendy meme</a> (which is not
actually latest as I think it got started some time in the Middle Ages),
and I do believe I got <a href="http://www.understated.co.uk/2007/five-things-about-me/">similarly poked by Matt Revell</a> on the same
subject a while back. So, five things you don't know about me. I ought
to note that I don't think that there <em>are</em> five things that <em>no-one</em>
knows about me, so you may know some or all of these.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosing_spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, a "chronic, painful, degenerative
    inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac
    joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine". The painful bit is
    certainly right; the medical stuff I take on trust. So, y'know,
    thanks a lot for that, Dad. It's an autoimmune disease, which is a
    term you never hear except on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080207004100/http://www.fox.com/house/">House</a> where they say it all the
    time, although on that programme they all have some kind of horrible
    serious thing that's going to kill them in two hours.</li>
<li>I'm moving jobs. In mid-March I leave <a href="http://www.mills-reeve.com/">Mills &amp; Reeve</a>, the law
    firm where I've worked for eight years, and I go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080207004100/http://www.gcapmedia.com/">GCap Media</a>,
    who own loads and loads of commercial radio stations. I'm pretty
    excited about this.</li>
<li>I was interviewed on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/local_radio/">BBC Radio Norfolk</a> once, along with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~cjwatson/">Kam</a>,
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080207004100/http://stir.facebook.com/profile.php?id=832103636">Natalie</a>, and Urgit, about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.eddings">alt.fan.eddings</a>.</li>
<li>I can roll my tongue. Apparently it's genetic; only some percentage
    of the population can do it. No idea why this is a useful genetic
    talent, although Richard Dawkins probably has a theory that it's all
    to do with making me more sexually attractive to women to increase
    my chances of passing on my genes or something.</li>
<li>I haven't seen any of the first three Star Wars films (that is, the
    last three in creation date but the first three of the nine, if you
    see what I mean). Just never got around to it. People keep telling
    me that I should do, and I just can't be arsed with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is anyone else tempted to just <em>make shit up</em> in these things? "I am
really Harlan Ellison." "I can suspend myself from a ledge by one
finger." "I have a third eye in the back of my head." "I can haz
cheezburger." It's pretty tempting. I'm supposed to tag other people.
Don't break the chain, etc, etc. To be honest I think this stuff gets
made up by demons who are determined to make the human race endure the
psychic pain of trying to think of things which are simultaneously (a)
interesting (b) secret (c) not <em>too</em> secret. I mean, if I was really a
Russian spy or had a third bollock or something, am I likely to talk
about this on the internet? Nonetheless, it is now my solemn duty to
make five people suffer as I have suffered. I think we'll have
