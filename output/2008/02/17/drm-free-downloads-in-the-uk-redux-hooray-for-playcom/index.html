			<p>My ceaseless quest for DRM-free mp3 download files in the UK appears to
be over! A while back <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2007/09/25/drm-free-mp3-downloads-from-amazon">I tested Amazon's mp3 store</a>, which was fine
except that you have to be in America. Fail. However, <a href="http://www.play.com">Play.com</a> have
just opened a similar store in the UK. As usual, my canonical test song
for these things is Feelin' Good by Nina Simone, and...I've just bought
it from Play. As before, I have a list of requirements for these
services:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can download one track, instead of a whole album; I don’t want ten
    Nina Simone songs, I just want the one I’m looking for - PASS</li>
<li>No DRM. None. I don’t mind what the format is, if there’s no DRM, as
    long as it can be played on Linux (which is pretty much everything).
    Bonus points for oggs. Half a bonus point for just plain mp3. - PASS</li>
<li>A track costs a pound or less. I’m not paying more than a quid for
    one song. - PASS (99c is about 50p)</li>
<li>I feel comfortable putting my credit card number into the site. This
    means, in practice, that if it’s called something like
    mp3downloads.haxx0r.ru, I am not interested. - PASS</li>
<li>I can just buy a song by putting my credit card number in and
    getting it for download. I don’t need to sign up for an account,
    give them all my details, none of that. - FAIL</li>
<li>My music tastes aren’t very eclectic, so I’d expect the service to
    carry most of what I’d want to listen to. This means that a service
    for one label alone isn’t really what I want. I don’t want to
    discover new music with this; I want to get the stuff I already know
    about and want to listen to. - PASS</li>
<li>I’ll get, probably, about five songs a year. So a subscription
    service is out, especially since with most of them your music stops
    working when you unsubscribe. - PASS</li>
</ul>
<p>As with Amazon, Play fail on the "don't need an account" idea. However,
there are two extra thoughts concerning that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They let you re-download the track later (an indeterminate number of
    times, depending on the record company) if you lose it or delete it.
    This is a good feature, and I can't think of a decent way of doing
    it without some sort of authorisation process.</li>
<li>I have mailed them with a suggestion. If someone's just buying
    downloads, why not have a "buy this without signing up" button,
    which just asks you for all the information that's required on the
    "buy it" screen? (You can't just enter a CC number; they need
    billing address and so on for the credit card companies, more's the
    pity.) Then, quietly sign them up for an account under the covers,
    and when you send the "you have bought a download, go here to
    download it" email, say "oh, and we signed you up for an account,
    with password GF78F\$0.Fsf;" and they can use it or not care. No
    idea whether the Play people will take this suggestion or not,
    though.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, it works. I can get songs and listen to them. Well done, Play.
That will do nicely.</p>
