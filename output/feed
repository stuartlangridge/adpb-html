(As Sam Hewitt &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StuartLangridge/posts/A1XypgwkMyU"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, I have &amp;#8220;become a themer&amp;#8221;.) I didn&amp;#8217;t know this was doable, and I went from not knowing this to having it done in the space of about half an hour. It is rare that something just works this nicely; I&amp;#8217;ve been living my life a long time and I know how it works. So far, the other shoe hasn&amp;#8217;t dropped, which is&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;At first, there was&amp;nbsp;Android&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my Android home screen now looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/random/android-minimal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty pleased with that. (The lock screen is even more minimal and pretty, but we&amp;#8217;re not talking about lock screens today: see &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StuartLangridge/posts/A1XypgwkMyU"&gt;the G+ post&lt;/a&gt; for what that looks&amp;nbsp;like.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; concern here &amp;#8212; in general, I don&amp;#8217;t like using icons without text to indicate a thing, because it means you&amp;#8217;re spending cognitive time remembering &lt;em&gt;what an icon stands for&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;what it&amp;#8217;s similar to&lt;/em&gt;. That is: icons are quite good for, say, files where you want to see that all of these are &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files, but they&amp;#8217;re not good for actions where you have to remember what a &amp;#8220;heart&amp;#8221; or some obscure little symbol means. I&amp;#8217;ve lost count of the number of times when I&amp;#8217;ve used a new app which only has icons and not text labels on its buttons and I have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; what half the icons &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;; a few things are enshrined by everyone using them (a Share icon, a Save icon, an Open icon, etc) but most of the time using an icon alone to indicate an action or an app is a bad idea. However, this is an exception to that rule. I am very familiar with my home screen; the set of apps on it do not change very much at all. So there&amp;#8217;s minimal cognitive load in remembering that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; icon is for Twitter and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; one is for Moon Reader. I do a reasonable proportion of that by spatial arrangement; the icons don&amp;#8217;t move around, and I am familiar and trained in where they are. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to ship a phone which looks like this to a new user, but it&amp;#8217;s a perfectly good experience for me, with my own personal home screen that I know&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this beautiful miracle achieved? Well. The default Android home screen doesn&amp;#8217;t let you change the icons used for apps. So when I discovered the (free!) &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.natewren.linesfree&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Lines icon set&lt;/a&gt; in the Play store my immediate thought was, cor, how does that work? And the answer is: use a different home screen app (in Android parlance, they&amp;#8217;re called &lt;em&gt;launchers&lt;/em&gt;). So I installed &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Nova Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. (This also had the rather nice benefit of allowing me to remove the hated Google search bar; I never, ever, ever used that because it shows results in some Google app rather than the web, meaning that you can&amp;#8217;t long-press on images to save them or on links to open in a new tab. Pack it in, Google. Open in the browser. It&amp;#8217;s good at that.) A little bit of setup with Nova Launcher and Lines and, lo, I had the nice minimal icons and pretty dark wallpaper (which came with Lines). Nova Launcher doesn&amp;#8217;t let you resize the icons, and by default they&amp;#8217;re a bit small, but you can buy the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Nova Launcher Prime&lt;/a&gt; add-on to enable that, and it was fifty pence so that&amp;#8217;s a no-brainer. The Lines icon set is both worryingly comprehensive (they claim to have over two thousand icons!) and equally worryingly incomplete (with a million apps in the Play store they&amp;#8217;re never going to carry them all, but not having Telegram? Seriously?) and so I added two more similar-looking icon sets (&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jimonen.glyphsyiconpack&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Glyphsy&lt;/a&gt;) to give me a wider choice. A bunch of tweaking of icon sizes, icon choices, margin sizes, and so on later and I have the screen above, and every time I look at it I like it a little more. Ultra-happy with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And then there was&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, hang on, it ought to be possible to do the same thing with Ubuntu phone, right? One can write a custom scope which looks like that and shows all one&amp;#8217;s apps, and add it to the Dash as the only scope, and then you&amp;#8217;ve got a cool-looking app-launcher home screen. Sweet. That&amp;#8217;s what I want. And it&amp;#8217;ll give me an excuse to play with all the new scopes stuff and learn something about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast,&amp;nbsp;grasshopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my basic idea. The existing apps scope is annoyingly slow; I&amp;#8217;m sure it does a whole bunch of stuff and that&amp;#8217;s why, but it&amp;#8217;s slow to load, slow to scroll, and slow to react to things changing. This is obviously being worked on by the Canonical team and I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll get better, but currently it&amp;#8217;s pretty frustrating. So I thought: what I&amp;#8217;ll do is this. I&amp;#8217;ll add a &lt;a href="http://click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hooks.html"&gt;click hook&lt;/a&gt; so when apps get installed and removed I can update a sqlite database, and then my scope will just hit that database rather than inspecting the filesystem and loading loads of files. That database can also hold the locations of icons in my custom &amp;#8220;wireframe&amp;#8221; icon theme, and it&amp;#8217;ll use those icons for the apps. So it&amp;#8217;ll be fast and have custom icons, and tapping an icon will launch that app via &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/platform/guides/url-dispatcher-guide/"&gt;an &lt;code&gt;application:///&lt;/code&gt; url&lt;/a&gt;. Job&amp;#8217;s a good&amp;#8217;un, etc. Off down the&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not as easy as I had&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that made the task difficult and which are basically my fault and for which no blame attaches to the Ubuntu team. Firstly, I&amp;#8217;m still running Ubuntu 14.04. This is because it&amp;#8217;s an long-term-support release, and LTSes don&amp;#8217;t offer to upgrade to the next &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; release (16.04, which came out in April) until the first point release (16.04.1, which isn&amp;#8217;t out at time of writing). This is so the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; gets a bit of testing before it hits all the people who desire stability, and is a good idea, and I am entirely happy with it. Secondly, I wanted to write the scope in JavaScript; one can write Unity 8 scopes in C++ (which I can&amp;#8217;t do), Go (which I can&amp;#8217;t do), and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; via node (which I am completely comfortable with). But the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scopes stuff is new, and so doesn&amp;#8217;t exist in 14.04. This meant that I had to do a great deal of faffing around in lxc containers to get a working version of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scope. However, that faffery did actually work out in the end, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see the need for it as due to anything more than my own desire to not upgrade away from the latest stable release &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt;. So, no blame there, as mentioned. After a bit of poking, I managed to get a JavaScript scope, and some discussions with Brian Douglass and one tiny bash deploy script later (which basically does &lt;code&gt;click build .&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;adb push&lt;/code&gt;es the &lt;code&gt;.click&lt;/code&gt; file to my Bq E4.5 and &lt;code&gt;pkcon install-local&lt;/code&gt;s it), I had a scope that I&amp;#8217;d written running on the phone. Hooray! Now to make that scope actually do and look as I want it&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we run into problems. The JavaScript scopes stuff is, admittedly, new, but it had two major issues that caused me a great deal of grief. The first is that making async &lt;code&gt;fs.readdir&lt;/code&gt; calls early in a scope &lt;code&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; handler were making my scope crash, and sometimes crashing all of Unity. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598967"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598967&lt;/a&gt;) Oops. That took some time debugging before I eventually went for the synchronous &lt;code&gt;fs.readdirSync&lt;/code&gt;, cursing all the while. Worse, though, is the &lt;code&gt;activate&lt;/code&gt; problem. You see, a scope, by default, when a thing is tapped shows you the &lt;em&gt;preview page&lt;/em&gt; for that thing. However, you can change things so that a tap on a thing does something directly; in this case, of course, I wanted a tap on one of my app icons to launch that app via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; dispatcher. To do that, you call &lt;code&gt;set_intercept_activation()&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/scopes/js/sdk-15.04.4/ScopeJS.CategorisedResult/"&gt;scope icon&lt;/a&gt; when you create it, and then Unity will call your scope&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;runtime_config.activate()&lt;/code&gt; method with the details when that icon is tapped; you can then handle it in whatever way you want, or return an &lt;code&gt;ActivationNotHandled&lt;/code&gt; type of &lt;code&gt;ActivationResponse&lt;/code&gt; to let Unity handle it for you, which in this case means &amp;#8220;open the app with the url you provided&amp;#8221;. (You can see a good example of how this works in Go in &lt;a href="https://github.com/bhdouglass/falcon/blob/master/src/falcon.go#L98"&gt;Brian Douglass&amp;#8217;s Falcon alternative app scope&lt;/a&gt;.) However! If you do that in JavaScript, your scope ignores the tap and throws an error about how you &lt;code&gt;returned nullptr from activate()&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598969"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598969&lt;/a&gt;.) As the bug says, &amp;#8220;this, in practice, means it&amp;#8217;s impossible to write a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scope which allows tapping on a result item to do anything other than show the preview (for example, launching an&amp;nbsp;app).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;#8217;s just a bug, and I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll get fixed (I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll both be fixed). It is frustrating (has nobody writing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scopes stuff ever &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;set_intercept_activation()&lt;/code&gt;? Isn&amp;#8217;t there lots of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt; built into the Ubuntu process now?) But it&amp;#8217;s a temporary thing, I&amp;#8217;m sure, and in the same class of &amp;#8220;frustrating and show-stopping but will be fixed eventually&amp;#8221; things as how &lt;code&gt;unity-js-scopes-tool&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t build &lt;code&gt;node-pre-gyp&lt;/code&gt; packages (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598971"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598971&lt;/a&gt;) or that &lt;code&gt;unity-js-scopes-tool&lt;/code&gt; seems to actually &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; binary itself but that&amp;#8217;s carefully kept secret for some reason, or that you have to remove and reinstall an app if you change the apparmor stuff otherwise the changes aren&amp;#8217;t picked up (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/click/+bug/1549369"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1549369&lt;/a&gt;) which cost me an hour of banging my head against the desk (thanks mzanetti for helping). They&amp;#8217;ll get fixed. Move&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things which actually stopped me building the scope I wanted weren&amp;#8217;t these sorts of incidental bugs; they&amp;#8217;re design decisions saying that what I want should not be possible. I&amp;#8217;m hoping that the detail I&amp;#8217;m going into here helps to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I want these things, and perhaps makes its way back to the team deciding on this stuff and helps to inform their&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example. You see how my Android screen above has four columns of app icons? Like the Ubuntu apps scope has? Well&amp;#8230; my replacement scope can&amp;#8217;t. Scopes are only allowed three columns of icons. The apps scope has been magically &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity8/+bug/1490388"&gt;hardcoded into Unity&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed four columns; nobody else can do that. That&amp;#8217;s pretty&amp;nbsp;annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, customisation of the look of a scope is superficially good but actually rather limited. A scope &lt;em&gt;header&lt;/em&gt; can have a custom background image, but a scope itself can&amp;#8217;t; you can pick a colour, but you can&amp;#8217;t set an image as the background for your scope. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-scopes-api/+bug/1598973"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598973&lt;/a&gt;) Scopes put the &amp;#8220;Ubuntu shape&amp;#8221; around all your scope icons, but you can turn that off by settings &lt;code&gt;ShapeImages=false&lt;/code&gt; in your scope ini file. Except&amp;#8230; that doesn&amp;#8217;t work; it&amp;#8217;s ignored, and you always get the Ubuntu shape border on every image, whether you want it or not. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-scopes-api/+bug/1598933"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598933&lt;/a&gt;) I understand the idea behind shaping imagery, but it looks heart-stoppingly ugly when done to icons with transparent backgrounds, such as all the &amp;#8220;wireframe&amp;#8221; icons I planned to use in this project. You can have settings for your scope, but they can&amp;#8217;t change the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt;, because that stuff&amp;#8217;s not programmatic; it&amp;#8217;s in the &lt;code&gt;scope.ini&lt;/code&gt; file and can&amp;#8217;t be changed by code. So I can&amp;#8217;t allow people to have a dark scope with white icons (as above) or choose a light scope with black icons. Also, making a replacement apps scope is essentially fruitless because the default apps scope cannot be removed. You can&amp;#8217;t turn it off; it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be present in your Dash. This to me seems strange; I&amp;#8217;m fine with you not being able to &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; it, but it will always be present in the bottom-edge menu. Fine, maybe making replacement apps scopes is an edge case, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to get the feeling that my phone is mine when I&amp;#8217;m obliged to keep the default apps scope around even if I&amp;#8217;ve got a&amp;nbsp;replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the idea of making the scope fast by populating a database? You can&amp;#8217;t have that, either. Yes, there are click hooks. But you can&amp;#8217;t install one. They must be stored in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/click/hooks&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;#8217;s part of the system image, which is read-only. What this means is that there&amp;#8217;s no way that a third-party app will ever be able to be informed of app installs and removals, sadly. I can put an app which requires extra permissions into the &lt;a href="https://open.uappexplorer.com/"&gt;Open Store&lt;/a&gt;, but even such an app can&amp;#8217;t install a click hook; I&amp;#8217;d have to make it a deb, and even then a deb won&amp;#8217;t install either unless you mark your image as read-write, which requires plugging it into a computer. Talking someone through that process is close to impossible unless they&amp;#8217;re the hardest of the hardcore Ubuntu touch hackers. Perhaps click might look in some other folder as well, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; accessible to apps, and have a new apparmor permission protect that folder? Then it would be possible for an application to request that permission and keep a database of installed and removed apps up to date, which would allow us to compete on making a better app launching&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all this means that the best I can do on Ubuntu is this. Ubuntu shapes around the transparent icons, no background imagery, three columns. And that&amp;#8217;s just not pretty, I&amp;#8217;m sad to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/random/appease.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I still have my beautiful Android home screen. But I&amp;#8217;ve reluctantly decided that I just can&amp;#8217;t do that on Ubuntu. Maybe it&amp;#8217;ll be possible later; maybe these bugs will be fixed and the design decisions revisited. I hope the above explains why I think that&amp;#8217;s important and what app developers could maybe do if those restrictions are slightly relaxed. Fingers&amp;nbsp;crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2016 00:27:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-07-05:2016/07/05/making-a-better-ubuntu-app-scope-not-very-successfully/</guid></item><item><title>ProgrammaticÂ Progressiveness</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/06/02/programmatic-progressiveness/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Chrome team have put together a thing called &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, a programmatic checker for whether a website is a progressive web app. It&amp;#8217;s a nice structure; it goes through a big list of checks on whether you&amp;#8217;ve got a manifest, whether performance is good, if the site&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt;, if you&amp;#8217;ve got icons defined, so on and so forth, and it&amp;#8217;s possible to add more (many more!) checks to the list. You can think of it as the list of criteria that a browser should use to tell whether it should put up the &amp;#8220;add to home screen&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as has been &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/05/24/the-importance-of-urls/"&gt;previously mentioned&lt;/a&gt; by me and &lt;a href="https://www.christianheilmann.com/2016/05/31/progressive-web-apps-and-our-regressive-approach/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, there is a bit of a worry that we&amp;#8217;re missing out on the Progressive part of Progressive Web Apps; that in the rush to check that you support exciting new features such as manifests and service workers, we&amp;#8217;re not also checking that your web site provides content to everyone, that it progressively uses those new features where they&amp;#8217;re available rather than &lt;em&gt;requiring&lt;/em&gt; them to be present, that you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/06/28/availability/"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; to everyone and not just to the&amp;nbsp;hippest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief diversion, here: I have occasionally probably strayed over the line from &amp;#8220;why aren&amp;#8217;t we doing better at this&amp;#8221; (which I do think) into &amp;#8220;why don&amp;#8217;t the Chrome team care about this&amp;#8221;, and that&amp;#8217;s not fair. Sorry, Chrome people. Accusation not&amp;nbsp;justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I&amp;#8217;d like to see is Lighthouse actually checking that your app is progressive as well as featureful. This is harder than it looks; progressive enhancement, like accessibility, is difficult to check programmatically. It&amp;#8217;s easy for a human to confirm that this site can still perform its basic actions if its scripts are blocked; it&amp;#8217;s a lot more difficult for a computer to do so. I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ll ever be able to say &amp;#8220;yes, you have definitely done everything right&amp;#8221;, here, much like we can&amp;#8217;t with accessibility. But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; flag that you&amp;#8217;ve done things&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve now got some code in Lighthouse which is a place we can build programmatic checks for progressiveness. At the moment it literally only checks whether there is any content at all if your &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"&gt;scripts don&amp;#8217;t load&lt;/a&gt;, and complains if you do not. That will catch sites which just serve &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and create their whole entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; in JavaScript; such sites are (thankfully) rare now, after a spate of them existing a few years ago. But we can do better than this. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to adequately create such tests, but if we can land a man on the moon we can come up with checks here, too. So, I&amp;#8217;d like to start a discussion around how we can programmatically check for signs that a website &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; doing progressive enhancement. What should we look for to show you&amp;#8217;re doing it right; what should we look for to show you&amp;#8217;re doing it wrong? If you have ideas, a good place to discuss them may be by &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues"&gt;filing issues against Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;; there, we can hash out details of whether a check makes sense, whether it&amp;#8217;s a good idea, how it can be made better. And then someone can build that check; if you&amp;#8217;re a developer, you can add an &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/master/src/audits/javascript"&gt;&amp;#8220;audit&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; to Lighthouse which has access to the page text and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and checks for warning signs or good signs and adds them to the report that Lighthouse creates. This is our chance to help stamp out sites that don&amp;#8217;t do things right, and help define that a progressive web app should actually be progressive.

&lt;p&gt;Lots of discussion about &lt;a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/"&gt;progressive web apps&lt;/a&gt; recently, with a general consensus among forward-thinking web people that this is the way we should be building things for the web from now on. Websites that work offline, that deal well with lie-fi&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="Jake Archibald eloquently names lie-fi as that situation where your phone claims to have a connection but actually it doesnât, the lying sack of dingoâs entrails that it is, and just spins forever when you tell it to connect to a website.

&lt;p&gt;We could discuss every part of that description, every word in that definition, for hours and hours, and if someone wants to nominate a pub with decent beer then Iâm more than happy to have that discussion and a pint while doing it. But today, weâre talking about the word &lt;em&gt;linkable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linkability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adactio.com"&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt;Â tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adactio/status/734873072042422273"&gt;Strongly disagree with Lighthouse wanting âManifestâs display property set to standalone/fullscreen to allow launching without address bar.â&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A littleÂ background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a little background. Google Chrome attempts to detect whether the website youâre looking at âqualifiesâ as a Progressive Web App, because if it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; then they will show an âinstall to home screenâ banner on your second visit. This is a major improvement over the previous state of a user having to manually install a site they like to their home screen by fishing through the menus&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="although the Chrome approach is not without its problems" href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-2" class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or using the âadd to home screenâ button in iOS Safari&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-3-back"&gt;&lt;a title="which is obscure enough that Matteo Spinelli made a library to show a pointer to the add-to-home-screen button; the library is wonderful, donât get me wrong, but it ought to not need to exist" href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-3" class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Chrome team have then created &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, a tool which invokes a Chrome browser, checks whether a site passes their checks for âthis looks like a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PWA&lt;/span&gt;â, and returns aÂ result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Jeremyâs point is this: Lighthouse is declaring that to be a valid &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PWA&lt;/span&gt;, you have to insist that when youâre added to the home screen, you stop showing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. And he doesnât agree,Â because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adactio/status/734875747169501185"&gt;I want people to be able to copy URLs. I want people to be able to hack URLs. Iâm not ashamed of my URLs â¦Iâm downright proud.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is inspirational stuff, and itâs true. URLs are important. Individual addressability of parts on the web isÂ important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. (You knew there was a âhoweverâ coming.) Whether your web app shows a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar is not actually a thing about that webÂ app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A little moreÂ background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit more background. In order to qualify as a progressive web app, you have to provide a manifest.&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-4-back"&gt;&lt;a title="If you donât know how to create one, see the manifest generator that Bruce and I created" href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-4" class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That manifest lists various properties about this web app which are useful to operating systems: what its human-readable name is, what a human-readable &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; name for it is, what its icon should be, a theme colour for it, &lt;a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/installable-web-apps/"&gt;and so on&lt;/a&gt;. This is allÂ good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the manifest also lists a &lt;a href="http://manifest.sysapps.org/#display-modes"&gt;&lt;code&gt;display_mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, defined in the spec as âhow the web application is being presented within the context of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; (e.g., in fullscreen, etc.)â Essentially, the options for the display mode are &lt;code&gt;fullscreen&lt;/code&gt; (the app will take all the screen; hardware keys and the status bar will not be shown), &lt;code&gt;standalone&lt;/code&gt; (no browser &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is shown, but the hardware keys and status bar will be displayed), and &lt;code&gt;browser&lt;/code&gt; (the app will be shown with normal browser &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, ie. as a normalÂ website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we see Jeremyâs point. Chrome propose that you only qualify as a ârealâ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PWA&lt;/span&gt; if you request âfullscreenâ or âstandaloneâ mode: that is, that you hide the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. Jeremy says that URLs are important; theyâre not a thing to hide away or to pretend that donât exist. And he has a point. The hackability of URLs is surprisingly important, and unsurprisingly dismissed by app developers who want to lock down the userÂ experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is the important point, &lt;em&gt;whether a web app shows its URLs is not a property of that app. Itâs a property of how that appâs developer &lt;strong&gt;thinks&lt;/strong&gt; about theÂ web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Property versusÂ preference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jeremy and I were both to work on a website, and then discuss what should be in the manifest, weâd agree on what the appâs name was, what a shortened name was, what the icon is. But we might disagree on whether the app should show a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar when launched. That disagreement isnât about the app itself; itâs about whether you, the developer, think itâs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to hide that an app is actually on the web, or whether you should proudly &lt;em&gt;declare&lt;/em&gt; that itâs on the web. That doesnât differ from app to app; it differs from developer to developer. The app manifest declares properties of the app, but the &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property isnât about the app; itâs about how the appâs developer wants it to be shown. Do they want to proudly declare that this app is on the web and of the web? Then theyâll add the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. Do they want to conceal that this is actually a web app in order to look more like ânativeâ apps? Then theyâll hide the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. The &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; property feels rather less like itâs actually tied to the app, and rather more like it should be chosen at âadd-to-home-screenâ time by the user; do you, the bookmarking user, prefer to think of this as a web thing? Include the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. Do you want to think of it as an app which doesnât involve the web? Hide the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. Itâs a preference. Itâs not aÂ property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On theÂ desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above argument stands alone. But there are additional issues with having a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar showing on an added-to-home-screen web app. We should discuss these separately, but here I have them in the same essay because itâs allÂ relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional issue is, essentially, this. On my desktop â &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; my phone â I add an app to my âhome screenâ. This might add it to my desktop as a shortcut icon, or to my Start Menu, or in the Applications list, or all of the above, depending on which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; Iâm on.&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-5-back"&gt;&lt;a title="and it should be noted that basically nobody actually handles PWAs properly on desktop yet; itâs all about mobile. But desktop is coming, and weâll need to solve this." href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-5" class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PWA&lt;/span&gt; declares itself as being &lt;code&gt;standalone&lt;/code&gt; then how to handle it is obvious: open it in a new window, with no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar showing. Similarly, &lt;code&gt;fullscreen&lt;/code&gt; web apps launched from an icon should be full screen. But what do we do when launching a &lt;code&gt;browser&lt;/code&gt; display-mode web app on aÂ desktop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since weâre launching something indistinguishable from just another browser tab, it should launch a browser tab, right? I mean, weâre opening something which is essentially a bookmark. Butâ¦ wouldnât it feel strange to you to pick something from your app menu or an icon from your desktop and have it just open a browser tab? It would for me, at least. So maybe we should launch a new browser window, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar intact, as though youâd clicked âopen in new windowâ on a link. But then Iâd have a whole new browser window for something which doesnât really &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; a whole new window; itâs just one more web page, so why does it get a window by itself? I manage my browser windows according to project; window A has tabs relevant to project A, window B has tabs relevant to project B, and so on. I donât want a whole new window, and indeed I have extensions installed so that links which think they deserve a new window actually get a new &lt;em&gt;tab&lt;/em&gt;Â instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs not very clear what should happen here. The whole idea of launching a website from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-level icon doesnât actually mesh very well at all with the idea of tabbed browser windows. It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mesh well with the 2002-era idea of a-new-browser-window-for-every-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, but that idea has gone away. We have tabbed browsing, and people like it.&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-6-back"&gt;&lt;a title="Whether tabbed browsing actually makes conceptual sense is not up for discussion, here; weâve collectively decided to use it, much as weâve collectively decided that one-file-manager-window-per-folder isnât the way we want to goÂ either." href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-6" class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chrome teamâs idea, that basically you canât add an â&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-level bookmarkâ for a website which wants to be treated &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a website, avoids theseÂ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremyâs got a point, though. Hiding away URLs, pretending that this thing youâre looking at is a ânativeâ app, does indeed sacrifice one of the key strengths of the web â that everythingâs individually addressable. You canât bookmark the âaccountâ page in Steam, or the âsettingsâ window in Keynote or Word or LibreOffice. With the web, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;. Thatâs a good thing. We shouldnât give it up lightly. But you already canât do that for apps which use web technologies but pretend to be native. If Word or iTunes used a WebView to render its preferences dialog, would it be good if you could link directly to it with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; like &lt;code&gt;itunes://settings&lt;/code&gt;? Yes it would. Would it be good if the iTunes user interface had a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar at the top &lt;em&gt;showing&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; all the time? Not really,Â no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a paternalism discussion, here. URLs are a good thing about the web; the addressability of parts is a good thing about the web. People donât necessarily appreciate that. How much effort should we put into making this stuff available &lt;em&gt;even though people donât want it&lt;/em&gt;, because theyâre &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; to not want it? Do we actually know better than they do? I think: yes we do.&lt;sup id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-7-back"&gt;&lt;a title="Hubris is a great idea. The Greeks taught us that." href="#sf-the-importance-of-urls-7" class="simple-footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But I donât know how important that is, when we can also win people over to the web by pretending that itâs native apps, which is what people wronglyÂ want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On balance, therefore, I approve of the Lighthouse teamâs idea that you donât qualify as an add-to-home-screen-able app if you want a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; bar. I can see the argument against this, and I do agree that weâre giving up something important, something fundamental to the web by hiding away URLs. But I think that wanting to see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is not a property of an app; itâs a property of &lt;em&gt;how &lt;strong&gt;you personally&lt;/strong&gt; want to deal with apps&lt;/em&gt;. So browsers should, when adding things to the home screen, pretend that &lt;code&gt;display:browser&lt;/code&gt; actually said &lt;code&gt;display:standalone&lt;/code&gt;, but give people who care the ability to override that if they want. And if we want more people to care, then thatâs what evangelism is for; having individual app developers decide how they want &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; app to be displayed just leads to fragmentation. Letâs educate people on why URLs are important, and then they can flip a switch and see the URLs for everything they useâ¦ but until weâve convinced them, letâs not force them to see the URLs when what they want is a native-likeÂ experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-the-importance-of-urls-1"&gt;Jake Archibald eloquently names lie-fi as that situation where your phone claims to have a connection but actually it doesnât, the lying sack of dingoâs entrails that it is, and just spins forever when you tell it to connect to a website.

}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nice little fillips about writing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; is that occasionally you use a colour code which turns out to be a word; the most famous here is probably &lt;code&gt;#DECADE&lt;/code&gt;. I ran across &lt;a href="http://bada55.io/"&gt;bada55.io&lt;/a&gt; which has made a whole site from this and was quite pleased, but the terrible old grammarian in me just can&amp;#8217;t deal with the l33tsp34k nature of most of the suggestions. You&amp;#8217;re obviously allowed &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;m prepared to allow &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; as O and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as I, but using &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; as an S or &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; as E is dubious, using &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as an L is &lt;em&gt;exceptionally&lt;/em&gt; dubious (especially when it&amp;#8217;s already being an I in the same word!), and &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; for T or &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; for A or &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;/G or (incomprehensibly) &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;/P are right out. The fun nature of the game goes away when you have to puzzle out the meaning of the word like it&amp;#8217;s a crossword clue or one of those horrid personalised number&amp;nbsp;plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we excise these crimes against spelling, all the colours that make what I consider to be proper words are below. There are obviously rather a lot of pastel shades, since each of the red, green, and blue channels will almost certainly be &lt;code&gt;A0&lt;/code&gt; or larger, but that&amp;#8217;s not necessarily a problem (and there are a couple of decent highly-saturated colours in there too; I&amp;#8217;m particularly fond of &lt;code&gt;#AC1D1C&lt;/code&gt; and plan to use it more often). If we admit white and black into the palette, it&amp;#8217;d almost certainly be possible to build a site while drawing solely from this list for your colour choices. Something to bear in mind for a future project,&amp;nbsp;maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="colour-word-box"&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #ab1ded"&gt;&lt;span&gt;abided&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="background: #0ff1ce"&gt;&lt;span&gt;office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addendum: I forgot about three-character hex colour codes! Of which there are also quite a few, and we do a lot better at the saturated ones this time because a whole channel is quite often &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Although it&amp;#8217;s less lexicographically elegant to use a three-character&amp;nbsp;word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="colour-word-box"&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #ace"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #add"&gt;&lt;span&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #ad0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ado&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #a1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;aid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #baa"&gt;&lt;span&gt;baa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #bad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #bed"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #d1e"&gt;&lt;span&gt;die&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #d0c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #f0b"&gt;&lt;span&gt;fob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #f0e"&gt;&lt;span&gt;foe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="background: #0ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addendum addendum: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dracos"&gt;Matthew Somerville&lt;/a&gt; points out a few more words, of varying acceptability in formal conversation :) I can only plead that &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/dict/words&lt;/code&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t contain the better ones in here (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IODIDE&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BODIED&lt;/span&gt;), and reiterate that I&amp;#8217;m not including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAE&lt;/span&gt; anywhere and I don&amp;#8217;t care if you think it&amp;#8217;s a word. Also, the &lt;a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; Colour Module Level 4 spec&lt;/a&gt; dangles the tantalising possibility of eight-hex-digit codes which can include an alpha channel (&lt;code&gt;#rrggbbaa&lt;/code&gt;) which would bring the excellent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CODIFIED&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACIDIFIC&lt;/span&gt; into the list, as well as the increasingly Latinate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FABACEAE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBIDIDAE&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COCCIDAE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="colour-word-box"&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #BABB1E"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABBIE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #B0D1ED"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BODIED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #D0BBED"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOBBED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #1DEAED"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDEAED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #10D1DE"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IODIDE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li style="background: #FAB"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #D1B"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="dark" style="background: #B0D"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s a game jam; the idea is to build a computer game. This one had an interesting restriction: the game had to be 64x64 pixels. So, we&amp;#8217;re going&amp;nbsp;old-school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d enter. So did about four hundred other people. It turns out that a jolly good way to get people to rate your game is for you to rate theirs and comment on it; then, your comment gets decorated with a link saying &amp;#8220;see their submission&amp;#8221; and they tend to follow it and rate you in turn. So, I wrote a bunch of short reviews. There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a way to link to all my reviews in a given jam on itch.io (although it would be good if there were!), so I&amp;#8217;ve collected them here for posterity. Note that these make no attempt to be comprehensive or fair or balanced; they&amp;#8217;re basically comments on what I thought of the games I played and why I didn&amp;#8217;t like them, if indeed I&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few games got a rating but not a comment; those aren&amp;#8217;t included. I also haven&amp;#8217;t included the actual ratings I gave, because those don&amp;#8217;t matter as much. The comments are mainly designed to be helpful to the game&amp;#8217;s developer, if&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only played in-browser games, because they&amp;#8217;re easiest to play, and I don&amp;#8217;t have the Unity web player so those games which require it didn&amp;#8217;t get played. It&amp;#8217;s good to see that a pretty high proportion of &amp;#8220;Unity&amp;#8221; games are using the Unity WebGL export so they can be played without the plugin! I also didn&amp;#8217;t play everything; with 188 games just in-browser, I was never going to get through them all. Pro-tip: this is one good reason to give your game nice imagery, so it looks interesting in a big&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, this was a lot of fun. There were an awful lot of things which were clearly only part-finished (didn&amp;#8217;t have sound, didn&amp;#8217;t have a way to win, didn&amp;#8217;t have title screens, and so on), but there were some really accomplished entries in here; things that I can absolutely imagine being a released game that one could play and have fun with. Nice work, indie game dev&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYKU1lvSF85cqJvB_aZrQpZKRduar59ct"&gt;watch Jupiter Hadley play &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the games on her YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;; at time of writing mine isn&amp;#8217;t done yet, but it should be over the next few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So!&amp;nbsp;Reviews!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61209"&gt;MatchMerchant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjEyMDkvMjc3NTg5LnBuZw==/147x117%23/6bmmoZ.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;The extra challenge provided by trying to match 4 (to get a potion) while not matching 3 (so the things disappear) adds an interesting extra wrinkle to this. The scene &amp;#8212; a potion seller, wizards &amp;#8212; adds some meaning to the game mechanic, and the graphics are good. Dragging is a little awkward, and unlike most match-3 games you can drag to swap any two pieces, which I didn&amp;#8217;t at first&amp;nbsp;realise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/59833"&gt;Time&amp;nbsp;Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNTk4MzMvMjY5NjAyLnBuZw==/147x117%23/ErbucG.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;I appreciate the idea of slowing down time. But I&amp;#8217;m not sure why I wouldn&amp;#8217;t play just with my finger on the shift key the whole entire time, thus turning the game into Bullet Time All The Time? Some puzzles which require performing them with time at normal speed would be nice, although maybe there are plenty and I just didn&amp;#8217;t get that&amp;nbsp;far&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(also, the sound made by the &amp;#8220;fire dots into the air&amp;#8221; triangles is not perfectly synchronised with actually firing dots into the air, which makes jumping over them considerably harder; this may have been a deliberate thing, but it&amp;#8217;s over the line between &amp;#8220;maliciously confusing&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;just annoying&amp;#8221;, for me at&amp;nbsp;least)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/60394"&gt;r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch, the ponderous music is quite painful to&amp;nbsp;endure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/62851"&gt;Kulten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjI4NTEvMjgzNTM3LmpwZw==/147x117%23/aanEOt.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Great graphics &amp;#8212; the text is a little hard to read at times, especially distinguishing D and O, or similar &amp;#8212; but the feel of the game is marvellous. It really misses&amp;nbsp;sound!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61569"&gt;micro-society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjE1NjkvMjc4Njg0LmdpZg==/147x117%23/U6Gelk.gif" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Interesting concept, although the 64px limitation maybe makes the representation a bit too abstract! Having new children get born just by walking into other players feels a bit weird, too. But there are some quite complex game mechanics underlying&amp;nbsp;this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/60758"&gt;Star&amp;nbsp;Shield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjA3NTgvMjc3ODMzLmdpZg==/147x117%23/UfTbwX.gif" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Obviously simple graphics, but easy to play. The white UFOs are terribly hard to kill! I&amp;#8217;m not sure what &amp;#8220;shield&amp;#8221; does; it certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t stop you being killed by bullets or collisions&amp;nbsp;:-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/60131"&gt;Castle&amp;nbsp;Storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjAxMzEvMjgwMDcyLnBuZw==/147x117%23/8rA3TP.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Really nicely put together; a complete and well-implemented fun game. The font is, as noted, a little hard to read, and it&amp;#8217;s sometimes hard to know why you&amp;#8217;re not allowed to buy a thing &amp;#8212; is it because you haven&amp;#8217;t bought one of the pre-requisites, or because you don&amp;#8217;t have enough money, or because you&amp;#8217;ve bought it already &amp;#8212; and that does break the immersion somewhat. Watching a Lord attacking the enemy castle is highly amusing. Nice&amp;nbsp;work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61044"&gt;Fast Escape&amp;nbsp;LowRez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjEwNDQvMjc0NzAzLnBuZw==/147x117%23/%2Ff03q%2B.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Maze gameplay boiled down to its simplest possible form. :) Agreed with bonus1up that some framing device and music and sounds would help it feel more like a game rather than a demo of the technique. The maze generator seems to generate some pretty tangled messes at times, and I roamed pretty aimlessly until I discovered the green exit block. A score or some method of assessing progress would be nice,&amp;nbsp;perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61046"&gt;Gummy Turbo&amp;nbsp;Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjEwNDYvMjc0NzExLnBuZw==/147x117%23/D8NZvJ.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;I see the idea, but I assume that the deadline landed before gameplay could be added. Nice start on an idea,&amp;nbsp;though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61049"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIRE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjEwNDkvMjc5NjcwLmdpZg==/147x117%23/%2Fh0b5o.gif" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Sadly, the game crashed with an error (screenshot at imgur) when I tried to increase the growth rate; I think I may have pressed &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; and Z at the same time. I love the concept; it would be nice to see a version of this which wasn&amp;#8217;t constrained to 64x64 and the Pico, as an art piece and less clunky to fiddle with the&amp;nbsp;parameters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/62664"&gt;Dungeon&amp;nbsp;Shifter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjI2NjQvMjgyODU3LnBuZw==/147x117%23/DHl9S8.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Interesting concept, and the graphics are nice (blocky, but nice). I don&amp;#8217;t think I understood what most of the &amp;#8220;control panel&amp;#8221; is actually for, though, and needing to control that by clicking while simultaneously either clicking arrows or using the arrow keys to go up and down means that the challenge is not &amp;#8220;playing the game&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;managing the controls&amp;#8221;, which I don&amp;#8217;t think is meant to be the challenging part&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/62915"&gt;64s&amp;nbsp;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I understand what the score is actually scoring, here. Button-mashing, once I started being &amp;#8220;attacked&amp;#8221; from all sides, got me up to 70 or so, but I didn&amp;#8217;t really have much of an idea what I was doing, and then my score reset to 0 and I didn&amp;#8217;t know what I&amp;#8217;d done wrong. It feels like there might be a good idea in here for twitch gameplayers and people who like Super Hexagon, but I think more feedback as to what&amp;#8217;s going on and why is&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The controls feel a little bit wonky; sometimes I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to jump and it wasn&amp;#8217;t clear why. Fun, though, and I won after only forty (!)&amp;nbsp;deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you say, an in-progress demo rather than a complete game, but what&amp;#8217;s there is pretty good. I like the single-colour palette; I can imagine this being a working game (once completed) on something like a watch or a single-use handheld&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also, it would be useful if continuing to the next level and starting that level were controlled with a keypress you&amp;#8217;re already using, such as up arrow, as well as restarting after death, rather than having to wait or press&amp;nbsp;R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, and basic graphics, but easy to play and understand, and the two offset guns provide a modicum of strategy when trying to shoot two different attackers at once. I won first time out, so the difficulty curve probably needs a bit of tweaking&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I didn&amp;#8217;t realise for quite some time that you can jump :) Sound effects would be good to go along with the music,&amp;nbsp;perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I think the difficulty curve is just about right, and the graphics are good; nice&amp;nbsp;work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I didn&amp;#8217;t really realise that I was supposed to be remembering the colours until after the first playthrough; maybe some minimal instructions, or a slide saying &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REMEMBER&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; before the colours&amp;nbsp;start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My game went out of its way to mock failure and have annoying voices and it&amp;#8217;s not a patch on this; I kept missing parcels because I wanted to punch the screen. Excellently done. Also, nice graphics, good sound work, and slick; a complete game. Only a weakling such as myself would rate it down because it&amp;#8217;s just too hard&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t realise that I was meant to shoot without being able to see Bond! Once I worked that out, and that the &amp;#8220;gunsight&amp;#8221; was actually moving even though it doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be because the background is all white, I was able to shoot at and hit 007. I like the music loudness approach (reminiscent of Find the Invisible&amp;nbsp;Cow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The game obviously needs work, as you know; as far as I can tell it&amp;#8217;s not possible to jump over two sets of spikes next to one another. You&amp;#8217;ll also not want to make the &amp;#8220;restart the game&amp;#8221; keypress also count as a &amp;#8220;jump&amp;#8221; keypress. But this could grow to be something good with more&amp;nbsp;work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is a demo that never got finished? The graphics are surprisingly impressive &amp;#8212; I particularly liked the realism of the rain &amp;#8212; but there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a purpose to the game (nor any sound), and walking through an elephant means that the elephant sticks right with you and flickers on and off, weirdly. Could be the nucleus of something impressive with lots more development, though; a good&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This made it really hard to play, I&amp;#8217;m afraid! Opening the frame in its own tab helps,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The low resolution meant that I didn&amp;#8217;t realise for quite a while that my car could be turned upside down and that&amp;#8217;s why I couldn&amp;#8217;t drive anywhere, though, and if you leave the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; alone for three seconds it scores a goal&amp;nbsp;:-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;#8217;t see how anyone could become an expert at this game rather than merely winning by&amp;nbsp;luck&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As noted, paying attention to the manual is pretty important to work out what&amp;#8217;s going on. Choosing the squares to move to feels unusually clumsy, by comparison with the rest of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; which actually flows pretty well once you&amp;#8217;ve got the hang of what you&amp;#8217;re doing. This feels like the video equivalent of what &amp;#8220;proper&amp;#8221; wargames (measure the hexes, spend time with books of tables calculating precise angles and damage for mortars, etc) are to Risk, and there&amp;#8217;s definitely an audience for&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(also, as @phantomax says&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s not meant to be called &amp;#8220;intense&amp;#8221;, is it?&amp;nbsp;:))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cute but rather bare graphics. The game&amp;#8217;s actually surprisingly hard. Instadeath for going off screen seems a bit harsh, rather than just locking the player to the&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it useful to apply a changed style to the canvas in the game: &lt;code&gt;canvas { height: 60vh; }&lt;/code&gt; makes it much bigger and easier to see, which may help with the issue you were having with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;viewport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting idea. It&amp;#8217;s really, really difficult though; maybe start slower and speed up over time? Otherwise it leads less to attempts to do better and more to just table-flipping annoyance and a move on to another game&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I can roll around, shoot white blocks (which moves them), and shoot the enemy (which moves them but doesn&amp;#8217;t kill them, to my surprise), but&amp;#8230; then what? I like the conceit of the rolling cube which fires in a particular direction, much like a bunch of single-player puzzles of this kind. The time limit on a move makes it all feel rather rushed, which is a little unfortunate because it makes the game feel like a very low rez arena deathmatch, rather than like a carefully thought-out chess&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That the merest touch of a burger bap on my mostly-complete burger counts as instadeath means that I end up playing the game by merely fleeing from burger tops like a gluten-free lunatic with a flour phobia, but that&amp;#8217;s perhaps part of the skill of the game.But without sound, it feels half-finished. This wouldn&amp;#8217;t take much to be turned into a really challenging game, I&amp;nbsp;think!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe there&amp;#8217;s something I missed, but a little tutorial level might have helped if there&amp;#8217;s an action I didn&amp;#8217;t know to do. Nice graphics and&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is alarmingly creepy. It also shamelessly violates the 64x64 pixel grid&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After the first day, the screen went red and I didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to do anything else, sadly. I like the graphical approach and the idea behind it,&amp;nbsp;though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took me some time to realise that collisions with (a) the rocks you&amp;#8217;re trying to mine and (b) the bottom of the tractor beam (?) are fatal and I&amp;#8217;m supposed to avoid that. Once I&amp;#8217;d got it, there is potential here; it&amp;#8217;s Thrust, but with the added attraction that the rock follows you around and you mustn&amp;#8217;t collide with it. Obviously it&amp;#8217;s just a prototype and therefore doesn&amp;#8217;t have music or backstory or anything, but I think this could be quite entertaining once it becomes a&amp;nbsp;game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/61115"&gt;Big&amp;nbsp;Sword&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

It does lend itself a bit to button mashing, but that&amp;#8217;s part of the old-school fun&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/62056"&gt;babelburger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d eat a burger which had a burger bun, a slice of lettuce, another slice of lettuce, and two more burger buns. Might be a bit bland :) That aside, the game takes real advantage of its low resolution and is rather fun! The logo&amp;#8217;s delightful, too. It&amp;#8217;s a little hard in initial play, perhaps; softening the difficulty curve just a tiny bit might be useful, so people can get beyond about two burgers without having to be the Flash. I suspect this might be easier with a&amp;nbsp;touchscreen&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay! 64 points! I still don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve quite grasped what the perfect tempo is, but I like the game a lot; quite a compelling challenge, and getting a hole in one is lovely&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly difficult for such a simple game mechanic! It would be worth cancelling the keypresses after you&amp;#8217;ve trapped them, so that up/down arrows don&amp;#8217;t navigate up and down the&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It may be worth prohibiting space bar presses from changing direction if they&amp;#8217;re pressed after the game has &amp;#8220;started&amp;#8221; but before the ship has actually started moving, because a few times I hit space to start when I thought my previous press hadn&amp;#8217;t been registered, only to discover that it had been registered but the ship is slow to get&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I managed to have two of my shapes completely disappear but I don&amp;#8217;t know whether that was a good thing or a&amp;nbsp;bad&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls are&amp;#8230; a bit difficult to get one&amp;#8217;s head around, but once mastered they&amp;#8217;re &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;. That you can&amp;#8217;t stop on a wall (you can either climb or slide, but not stay still) is a touch weird, but getting to grips with that is the required skill, perhaps. The music is a cool track but maybe a bit overdramatic for the actual gameplay. This is the kernel of a good idea, I think; could be good with&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Having a computer enemy would be good for practice, although I fell off enough all by&amp;nbsp;myself&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sailing around does feel a bit aimless, especially since I don&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to re-visit an island where I died (does it sink back into the sea when the crabs make a kill or something?). Once I&amp;#8217;d worked out that the combat relied on me hitting the arrow keys in time with those on screen rather than just as fast as possible, I never lost another battle, so that was nice&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Game seems smooth but occasionally the framerate drops. I killed a monster but then wasn&amp;#8217;t sure what to do; shooting the &amp;#8220;cells&amp;#8221; seems to make them react, but they don&amp;#8217;t die, and shooting the big &amp;#8220;cell&amp;#8221; in the middle makes the screen flash and we get a &amp;#8220;gasp!&amp;#8221; sound effect but that doesn&amp;#8217;t die&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I particularly appreciate that inadvertently touching an enemy is not instadeath! I do occasionally find myself leaping a bit into the unknown because it&amp;#8217;s hard to see what&amp;#8217;s coming up, but perhaps that&amp;#8217;s a feature rather than a&amp;nbsp;bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, that&amp;#8217;s part of the game, but it&amp;#8217;s probably a bit far over the frustrating-vs-fun line for me. I also spent almost the whole first playthrough thinking that the little darker green &amp;#8220;grass&amp;#8221; things were flowers and failing to understand why nothing worked :) The swarming effect is really&amp;nbsp;nice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding things is really, really hard. Not, like, &amp;#8220;I must get expertise&amp;#8221; hard, but &amp;#8220;solid wall of unavoidable rocks&amp;#8221; hard. I like the slightly drifty slow uncontrollable nature of the astronaut, which fits with the low-gravity backstory, but combining that with the sheer volume of rocks makes survival pretty much&amp;nbsp;impossible&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Other than that, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; seems quite smooth and nice. The game&amp;#8217;s a lot harder because you can&amp;#8217;t use the same ingredient twice! I expected the &amp;#8220;troll&amp;#8217;s eye&amp;#8221; to do something special because I was especially given it in the opening cutscene, but maybe that&amp;#8217;s just&amp;nbsp;misinterpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly, I expected red berries to be an instakill and was pleased to see that they drop you a size category instead. The game is very easy, though; I won on the second and all subsequent tries&amp;nbsp;:-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t see what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRIENDS&lt;/span&gt;? or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPACE&lt;/span&gt; actually mean. Possibly the whole game is to work that out, but the hurdle makes me turn away rather than puzzle to figure it out&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr style="width:50%; clear: left"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/59866"&gt;Oort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(no sound, though?)
Obviously unfinished, as mentioned in the description. That said, I like that the jumps are absurdly high by comparison with other platforms (and in addition to this absurdly high jump we have a double jump which is doubly absurdly high); it changse the way I think about the game a surprising amount for such a nominally small change. Being followed about by the nasty things with red eyes and being unable to shake them off is also an interesting mechanic, and I like their hammers. As noted, the space-to-&amp;#8220;attack&amp;#8221; thing doesn&amp;#8217;t actually do anything other than draw a dotted circle around me and freeze the game, so i suspect that&amp;#8217;s not yet implemented. But there&amp;#8217;s the core of a good thing here; interesting graphics, interesting divergence from standard platforming rules with the high jump, and I&amp;#8217;d like to see&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And the game I thought was&amp;nbsp;best&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/62872"&gt;Slumber&amp;nbsp;Knight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjI4NzIvMjgzNjA5LnBuZw==/147x117%23/zWPk1y.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;Great fun game; graphics are well done, sound matched, good feel to the game. Nice one! Full&amp;nbsp;marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Slumber Knight. Delightful graphics and feel. I confessed to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kakus_dev"&gt;the developer&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter that I ended up hacking the game a bit so I could see how it ended, by making myself immune to collisions, but that&amp;#8217;s not a bad thing about the game, it&amp;#8217;s a bad thing about my impatience. It&amp;#8217;s excellent&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And&amp;#8230; what I&amp;nbsp;did&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNjA3MDAvMjczODk1LnBuZw==/147x117%23/qOjAPM.png" style="float: left; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; width:128px"&gt;I did, of course, enter a game myself. It&amp;#8217;s called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016/rate/60700"&gt;Have You Seen This Image?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, and you can play it. It was deliberately simple &amp;#8212; I didn&amp;#8217;t want to devote much time to writing it &amp;#8212; but I really enjoyed the experience of building a complete game, releasing it, and seeing people rate it. A pretty common theme in the comments was that it doesn&amp;#8217;t _quite_ explain exactly what you need to do, but I think everybody gets it after one playthrough, and playthroughs are very quick indeed. (I put some effort into making sure that you can start again without having to wait as soon as you die.) The juxtaposition of the abusive failure messages with the marvellously jaunty music still makes me laugh every time I play it. (The music is &lt;a href="https://incompetech.com/wordpress/2015/11/pixelland/"&gt;Pixelland&lt;/a&gt; from the incomparable Kevin MacLeod.) Images were from Wikipedia; after some help from the #wikimedia-tech &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; channel, I discovered &lt;a href="https://quarry.wmflabs.org/"&gt;Quarry&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to run arbitrary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; queries against the Wikimedia databases from inside the browser, and is a very excellent thing indeed. So I wrote &lt;a href="https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/8832"&gt;a query to return all 64x64 images from Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; and then picked a bunch of them. In order to make the game more difficult, I then made three copies of each image, tinted blue, red, and green respectively, so you&amp;#8217;d see images that you might have seen before but in different colours. And that was that. There&amp;#8217;s a bug in there somewhere which causes two success sounds to play at once (so you get the game saying &amp;#8220;Awesome!&amp;#8221; _and_ &amp;#8220;Fantastic!&amp;#8221; when you get it right sometimes), but after trying and failing to work out why, I&amp;#8217;ve reclassified it as a feature because it amuses me to hear the sounds anyway. So, conclusion: writing a game is fun; hanging out with the game jam community is fun; thank you to popey for nudging me into doing it; and I came 72nd for game feel, which I am perfectly happy with. Must do this again at some&amp;nbsp;point.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2016 18:12:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-04-26:2016/04/26/lowrezjam-reviews/</guid></item><item><title>The wisest wordsÂ spoken</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/04/25/the-wisest-words-spoken/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;If all the world&amp;#8217;s a stage&lt;br&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve been describing people who want to use an ad-blocker really as falling into four categories; these obviously cross over a lot, and most people will have aspects of&amp;nbsp;each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ads are bad for&amp;nbsp;privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary concern here, ads that track you around the internet. Advertising &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t so bad; it&amp;#8217;s when the ad networks build up a list of sites you look at by dropping tracking cookies on you, and then create a profile of you and what you do and what you care about. There are potential benefits here &amp;#8212; if you&amp;#8217;re going to see adverts, then they might as well be for stuff you&amp;#8217;re interested in, right? &amp;#8212; but in a post-Snowden world, having this sort of profile of you available to a company who may not have your best interests at heart and may hand it over to whoever asks for it when compelled or paid isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily a good thing. People who feel this way find that worrying. You can see your &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated"&gt;Google ads profile&lt;/a&gt; from your Google account, and get a sense of the sort of demographic information that has been built up about you, and you can change your list of interests or opt out entirely; most ad networks don&amp;#8217;t have this level of control. The &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; browser extension is primarily designed to alleviate this sort of worry, by permitting ads but removing any tracking cookies, or blocking ads and script requests that attempt to do&amp;nbsp;tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ads are bad for&amp;nbsp;performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary concern: that a page full of adverts loads much more slowly, because the script in the ads holds up the page, and because the ads themselves take a lot of time to download. &lt;a href="http://blog.lmorchard.com/2015/07/22/the-verge-web-sucks/"&gt;Les Orchard did a great job analysing The Verge&lt;/a&gt; and showed that an article with 57K of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; also included nearly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;10MB&lt;/span&gt; of ads and took thirty seconds to download. (The Vox Media team are &lt;a href="http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/5/6/8561867/declaring-performance-bankruptcy"&gt;working on it&lt;/a&gt;.) It&amp;#8217;s quite startling how much faster a page is when it&amp;#8217;s not downloading 200 times its own weight in extra advert code; this is what&amp;#8217;s behind the &lt;a href="https://www.ampproject.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; initiative, although it&amp;#8217;s not clear whether that serves the needs of people solely or whether it&amp;#8217;s a bit of a landgrab by a few big companies. But it&amp;#8217;s nonetheless a response to this performance issue, and I suspect that the only reason more people do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; identify themselves with this concern over performance is that they don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;realise&lt;/em&gt; how much faster the web ought to be when done right. (Also, here, see Progressive Web&amp;nbsp;Apps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ads are visually&amp;nbsp;disruptive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair few people don&amp;#8217;t necessarily mind adverts as a concept but dislike the actual ads we&amp;#8217;ve got, because they animate or flash colours or move around or play a video when you inadvertently mouse over them; that is, they&amp;#8217;re distracting and terrible. People who feel like this tend not to mind, for example, text ads on the side of a set of search results, but don&amp;#8217;t like awful flashing things. It makes it difficult to see what you&amp;#8217;re actually reading. One of the larger offences in this particular category are ads which make a page&amp;#8217;s content jump around; the ad appears after page load and pushes everything below it down, leading to immense annoyance on the part of someone reading the pushed-around thing (and screwing up the scroll position if you&amp;#8217;ve just hit&amp;nbsp;Back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to see any ads at&amp;nbsp;all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are those who feel that they ought to not see any ads whatsoever, and if publishers have a problem with that, then the publishers need to solve&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the important point. In general, complaints about ad blocking (from publishers, from adtech companies, from ad networks, and the like) tend to assume that everyone&amp;#8217;s solely and completely in the last category. That is: the argument that ad blockers are bad goes &amp;#8220;you just don&amp;#8217;t care about how we fund the stuff that you read for free&amp;#8221;. This is, I suggest, not the case for everyone. Yes, there are some people &amp;#8212; plenty of people &amp;#8212; who &lt;em&gt;just don&amp;#8217;t want any ads&lt;/em&gt;, and take a brutal and blasÃ© attitude (&amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s not my problem you&amp;#8217;re relying on a crappy business model&amp;#8221;), and ignore the very tragedy-of-the-commons outcome of this (if everyone does it, we break everything). But, I think (and I&amp;#8217;d love to see data on this, beyond the anecdata I have from talking to people) that some if not most people don&amp;#8217;t dislike ads &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; ads, they dislike &lt;em&gt;the ads we get&lt;/em&gt;. Because the ads we get are visually distracting, privacy-invasive, and slow down the web to the point of ridiculousness. Maybe if adverts didn&amp;#8217;t track us around the internet, didn&amp;#8217;t screw up reading a page, and didn&amp;#8217;t take thirty seconds to load, everyone wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so quick to blame &amp;#8220;ads&amp;#8221; and could instead blame &amp;#8220;bad&amp;nbsp;ads&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;#8230; maybe it&amp;#8217;s too late, now. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s quite possible that the ad industry has pissed so comprehensively in this waterhole that there&amp;#8217;s no way to come back from this and offer ads that can fund producers and aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;dreadful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-03-15:2016/03/15/reasons-to-not-like-ads/</guid></item><item><title>Mothering</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/03/07/mothering/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, my fortieth Mothering Sunday. Although I don&amp;#8217;t remember 
the first few. We don&amp;#8217;t always agree, my mum and I. We 
might argue about politics (she&amp;#8217;s quite a lot more right 
wing than me, mainly from reading the Daily Mail). But, 
honestly, these days, we mostly do. It&amp;#8217;s nice, that. I like 
that I have parents, both mum and dad, who I can ring up 
and tell them about how work is going and who I&amp;#8217;m hoping to 
get as clients and which flats I want to&amp;nbsp;buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re currently avoiding talking to your parents, because they&amp;#8217;re 
just annoying or something&amp;#8230; you should think about 
rebuilding that bridge. It&amp;#8217;s worth hearing from&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really. I&amp;#8217;m glad I hear from mine. Happy Mother&amp;#8217;s Day,&amp;nbsp;mum.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2016 00:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-03-07:2016/03/07/mothering/</guid></item><item><title>Lost in theÂ Maze</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/02/20/lost-in-the-maze/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, as part of my &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/01/31/what-i-did-on-my-holidays/"&gt;month-long birthday celebration&lt;/a&gt;, Niamh and I went to &lt;a href="https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/maze/"&gt;Gordon Ramsay&amp;#8217;s Maze restaurant&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/maze.jpg" alt="The Maze restaurant internal sushi bar, lit with purple neon"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were, honestly, a bit worried at first; we&amp;#8217;d bought it as a âRed Letter Daysâ voucher, and when we got there and explained this, there was a certain amount of &amp;#8220;er, we don&amp;#8217;t know how to deal with that&amp;#8221; and barely concealed snootiness at us having a &lt;em&gt;voucher&lt;/em&gt; like the terrible commoners we are and so on. And that got combined with us saying that Niamh is both vegetarian (well, she eats fish, otherwise we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been in a sushi place, of course) and gluten-free, at which there was further barely-concealed snootiness at first. But, they got over it. And quite well, too; the remainder of the evening, the staff were the souls of courtesy, and that helped a lot; good one the&amp;nbsp;Maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/us-before.jpg" alt="Niamh and I, getting ready to go out, full of smiles"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were having the seven-course tasting menu. I approve of this&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we did the shameful Instagram thing and took pictures of all the&amp;nbsp;courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/champagne.jpg" alt="A glass of bubbly"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free glass of champagne! Actually, two free glasses; they seemed to think that Niamh was 18. However, she doesn&amp;#8217;t like it, so that&amp;#8217;s two free glasses for the birthday&amp;nbsp;boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/crab.jpg" alt="Kani snow crab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kani snow crab, wakame,&amp;nbsp;wasabi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/kingfish.jpg" alt="Hiramasa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiramasa: kingfish, pecan nut, red onion vinaigrette. (I really liked the crunch of the pecans in this. Will steal this&amp;nbsp;idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/tuna.jpg" alt="Spicy tuna tartare"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spicy tuna tartare, chilli garlic, yuzu avocado, wonton crisps. (We have decided that it ought to be possible to do a whole meal with the courses served inside a&amp;nbsp;fruit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/niamh.jpg" alt="Niamh tucking in"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/platter.jpg" alt="The chef's sushi platter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chef&amp;#8217;s sushi platter: from left, wasabi, pickled ginger (which I again ate a bunch of in one go after Niamh lied and told me it was chilli garlic, which it was not), salmon, kingfish, sea bass, tuna, crab, tuna. The crab was the nicest; Niamh&amp;#8217;s is pictured with puffed rice and mine had little wheat&amp;nbsp;strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/pork.jpg" alt="Pork belly"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suckling pig belly, crackling, mandarin salad, pork jus. Of course, Niamh didn&amp;#8217;t have this, and instead&amp;nbsp;had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/fish.jpg" alt="fish and radish salad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish (of some kind, we can&amp;#8217;t remember) with radish salad and cream&amp;nbsp;sauce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/mango.jpg" alt="No man goes like a mango goes"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mango with lime and shichimi pepper is what the menu says, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure that&amp;#8217;s what this was. It was a sort of mango foam as a palate cleanser, and was&amp;nbsp;delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/dryice.jpg" alt="Dry ice clouds boiling all over our table"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a cool thing happened. They brought out a dish of lemons, and then poured water into it; it turned out it was a dish of lemons &lt;em&gt;and solid carbon dioxide pellets&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that we had boiling clouds of dry ice flowing all over the table, and we were massively impressed. Also took the opportunity to revise what &amp;#8220;sublimation&amp;#8221; is in preparation for Niamh&amp;#8217;s chemistry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCSE&lt;/span&gt; in a couple of&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/lemon-pie.jpg" alt="Lemon pie"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemon pie with Italian meringue and passionfruit&amp;nbsp;sorbet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/passionfruit.jpg" alt="Passionfruit meringue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niamh&amp;#8217;s passionfruit meringue with lemon and lime curd (since lemon pie has pastry&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/mazepics/us-at-maze.jpg" alt="Niamh and I, at the Maze"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like the Maze. Nice work, restaurant team. More sushi for&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2016 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-02-20:2016/02/20/lost-in-the-maze/</guid></item><item><title>Android apps and sensitiveÂ permissions</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/02/05/android-apps-and-sensitive-permissions/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two days, I&amp;#8217;ve installed two Android apps (names redacted because it&amp;#8217;s not their fault!) which, on install, have popped up a custom notification saying that the app &amp;#8220;requests Sensitive&amp;nbsp;Permissions&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;: this is not these apps&amp;#8217;s fault. It is &lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; File Explorer&amp;#8217;s&lt;/u&gt; fault. Uninstall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; File Explorer. And everything below applies to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; File Explorer&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/android-sensitive-permissions/notification.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin: auto; display: block; box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #000;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapping this notification pops up a thing named &amp;#8220;Apps Analyze&amp;#8221; which pretends to be analysing the stuff on your phone and then shows you a bunch of irrelevant information about your phone and weather and Facebook info, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the app you&amp;nbsp;installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/android-sensitive-permissions/splash.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin: auto; display: block; box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #000;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://kryogenix.org/images/android-sensitive-permissions/apps-analyze.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; margin: auto; display: block; box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px #000;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear. This is &lt;em&gt;bullshit&lt;/em&gt;. This is nothing more than malware. I wanted to dim my screen, or buy a sandwich. I did not want to have my phone &amp;#8220;analysed&amp;#8221;; I did not want &amp;#8220;sensitive permissions&amp;#8221;. I don&amp;#8217;t think this thing needs permissions at all; at the very best it&amp;#8217;s a completely unwanted bundled thing, like Oracle bundling adware with their Java installer. At worst, it&amp;#8217;s some sort of unpleasant malware which harvests data from my phone and ships it off somewhere. I don&amp;#8217;t know what it does; it&amp;#8217;s certainly bloatware at the very least; there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/43fkl5/es_file_explorer_appears_to_have_moved_from/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know where this is coming from; since it&amp;#8217;s shown up in two separate apps, it&amp;#8217;s presumably some sort of third-party component, and presumably the authors of it pay app developers to include it.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;strong&gt; I do know where it&amp;#8217;s coming from; it&amp;#8217;s from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; File Explorer.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are an Android app developer and you are using this thing, fucking pack it in. This is a hysterical betrayal of your users&amp;#8217; trust. I know it&amp;#8217;s hard work to monetise software that you write. I know it&amp;#8217;s tempting to scrape the barrel like this. But if you are using this, you are a terrible person and you should sit down and have a bloody word with yourself. Stop it. You&amp;#8217;re pissing in the waterhole and ruining things for everyone. Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be part of this race to the&amp;nbsp;bottom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;It&amp;#8217;s possible that this is an official Android thing, since it&amp;#8217;s also showing up in Google Sheets and so on. If so, Android people, what the hell are you thinking of?&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 12:52:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-02-05:2016/02/05/android-apps-and-sensitive-permissions/</guid></item></channel></rss>
