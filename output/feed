&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/trypod/"&gt;Aaron alerts me&lt;/a&gt; to the recent initiative of sharing one&amp;#8217;s favourite podcasts with the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trypod"&gt;#trypod&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds like fun, speaking as a podcast listener and performer. So, here&amp;#8217;s the stuff I listen to, at the moment (it is April&amp;nbsp;2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://brokenjars.xyz/dresden-files-podcast/"&gt;The Dresden Files&amp;nbsp;podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/dresden.png"&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re sitting about waiting for the next Harry Dresden book, you&amp;#8217;ll like this. An excellent example of fandom; to someone outside the club they just ceaselessly hash over the books, but I think that&amp;#8217;s good fun both to do and to listen to. And I&amp;#8217;ve learned about quite a bit that I missed, as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.relay.fm/rocket"&gt;Rocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/rocket.png"&gt;Rocket&amp;#8217;s great. Very tech-focused, and the presenters skew a little more to the journalism side than other tech podcasts which tend to be more developer or sysadmin-based. If you like the stuff that I do, you&amp;#8217;ll probably like this. Look here for commentary on what&amp;#8217;s going on in the tech world, plus quite a lot of laughing at one another&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://ubuntupodcast.org/"&gt;The Ubuntu&amp;nbsp;podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/ubuntu.png"&gt;Admittedly made up of friends of mine, but that&amp;#8217;s not the point. Amusing commentary on tech and open source stuff, with an Ubuntu slant, but these days they end up talking more about weird little hardware projects and Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; than what Canonical are up to. It&amp;#8217;s fun; they try for a &amp;#8220;family-friendly&amp;#8221; sort of vibe as well. While on-air, at&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://westwingweekly.com/"&gt;West Wing&amp;nbsp;Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/westwing.png"&gt;An episode-by-episode relisten-to and discussion-of The West Wing, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; programme. This is fandom stuff, much like Dresden above, but one of the two presenters is John Malina who played Will Bailey in the show and so they tend to have lots of interviews with members of the cast, the writers, the directors, and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/simply-elementary"&gt;Simply&amp;nbsp;elementary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/elementary.png"&gt;This covers elementary, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;. They tend to go fairly in-depth on specific aspects or projects from the elementary team, although not always (they had me on once and were berated about various things, which I&amp;#8217;m grateful for the chance to have done). Worth listening to if you&amp;#8217;re part of the elementary&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/shows/http203/podcast/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/http203.png"&gt;The legendary and legendarily infrequent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; 203 podcast. Web development, right up at the cutting edge (sometimes considerably past the cutting edge and into the field on the other side of the road) from Jake Archibald and Paul Lewis of the Google Chrome developer relations team. About 20% amazing insight on what the web is and where it&amp;#8217;s going, another 20% them describing interesting web things they&amp;#8217;ve been up to, and the remainder off-colour stories and arsing about, which is marvellous stuff. If you&amp;#8217;re a web dev and you&amp;#8217;re not listening to this I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s wrong with&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrss1"&gt;More or Less: Behind the&amp;nbsp;Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/moreorless.png"&gt;From the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;. A short but frequent programme in which they do a deep-dive into some quoted or reported bit of statistics and explain whether it&amp;#8217;s right and what it means. I&amp;#8217;ve learned quite a lot from&amp;nbsp;this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linuxvoice.com/category/podcasts/"&gt;Linux&amp;nbsp;Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/lv.png"&gt;From the editorial team of the late, great Linux Voice magazine. They&amp;#8217;re amusing to listen to, and they&amp;#8217;ve often got up to quite a bit. Notable for &amp;#8220;Voice of the Masses&amp;#8221;, which involves various audience polls, and &amp;#8220;Finds&amp;#8221;: random things and bits of software they&amp;#8217;ve discovered this week and want to&amp;nbsp;mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://player.fm/series/mark-steadmans-escape-hatch-brum-radio"&gt;Mark Steadman&amp;#8217;s Escape&amp;nbsp;Hatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/steadman.png"&gt;Mark Steadman and his guest on Brum Radio do an extended hour-long interview and also play a sort of Choose Your Own Adventure game; something like a very constrained role-playing session. When I was on it I won and didn&amp;#8217;t die! Yay! So that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://latenightlinux.com/"&gt;Late Night&amp;nbsp;Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="podcast" src="https://kryogenix.org/images/podcasts-2017/lnl.png"&gt;Traditional-style Linux podcast, but a good laugh; Joe, Ikey, Félim, and Jesse kick around some ideas, Ikey goes on about the distro he builds, they look at news and goings-on. For Linux people only, pretty much, but if you are then it&amp;#8217;s one of the better&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And&amp;nbsp;finally&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="Bad%20Voltage"&gt;http://badvoltage.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://badvoltage.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.badvoltage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/logo1.png" style="background-color: black"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 14:47:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-04-03:2017/04/03/podcasts-i-like/</guid></item><item><title>A walk along the arches</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/04/02/a-walk-along-the-arches/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, this evening, there were beers with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dnews"&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/takesdcake"&gt;Ebz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/__cmm"&gt;Charles&lt;/a&gt; and after a brief flirtation with the Alchemist (where we didn&amp;#8217;t go, since the bar was three deep and they might be good at cocktails but they&amp;#8217;re really, really &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; at cocktails and so I didn&amp;#8217;t fancy waiting fifteen minutes just to get to the bar) and the Bureau (who are also good at cocktails, and sell an interesting Czech lager with a picture of the brewery on the glass (and while I&amp;#8217;m on the subject, why does every bar feel it necessary to sell me Beer X in a Beer X-branded glass these days? I really don&amp;#8217;t care, bar staff of the world. Don&amp;#8217;t feel like you have to)), we descended upon the &lt;a href="http://www.indianbrewery.com/"&gt;Indian Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in their new place under the arches. Honestly, up to now, I&amp;#8217;d tried their Birmingham Lager in cans (perfectly nice), and that was it; I&amp;#8217;d never been to their bar. And it&amp;#8217;s fabulous. I was vaguely peckish before getting there but I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have bothered with anything; I flirted with the menu in Bureau but was basically ungrabbed by whatever it is that grabs me about menus. And then we piled out of the cab (which we&amp;#8217;d got in to save Ebz and her tottery heels; obviously Sport Dan would have walked the distance to get there but I was quietly glad of not having to) into Indian and the delectable smell of the place completely turned me around. Twenty feet from the place I was mildly thinking about food; six feet from the door I was ready to eat a horse, and one of my companions, and possibly a road sign. This is a place that knows how to capitalise on the weaknesses of their punters. On the way in the door we we interrupted by a chap who, tactfully, hasn&amp;#8217;t skipped many lunches, who asked us: are you eating? Yes, we all said, salivating. And this helpful chap cleared away a small end of a table &amp;#8212; the Indian Brewery interior is organised as a batch of wooden benches, like the ones you get in a pub garden. So if you&amp;#8217;re not eating, he&amp;#8217;ll find you a space to sit in between others; if you are, he&amp;#8217;ll find you a slightly larger block, possibyl by elbowing those already there. And the friendliness doesn&amp;#8217;t end there. Everything, from the Bollywood posters on the wall to the attitude of the staff and the casual, no-frills nature of the layout exudes friendliness; it feels welcoming, like someone took the concept of welcomingness and distilled it out of the air into an atmosphere that pervades the whole place and stepping into it feels like a hot bath. And the Fat Naan is utterly delightful. &amp;#8220;Are you sure you want a whole fat naan to yourself?&amp;#8221; asked Dan. Yes. Yes, I was sure. And I was right. It was bloody delectable. Honestly, I can&amp;#8217;t recommend it enough. Good beers (and a good &lt;em&gt;selection&lt;/em&gt; of beers, moreover, which I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting), great Indian food, friendly staff. If you want more from a place, I can&amp;#8217;t see what it is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 01:45:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-04-02:2017/04/02/a-walk-along-the-arches/</guid></item><item><title>Enable Compiz in Ubuntu MATE to fix dragging the window borders</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/04/01/enable-compiz-in-ubuntu-mate-to-fix-dragging-the-window-borders/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/"&gt;Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you may have found that it&amp;#8217;s really difficult to resize windows; you can move your mouse pointer over the edge of a window to drag the window bigger or smaller, but the &amp;#8220;grab area&amp;#8221; is only one pixel wide. This is alaarmingly&amp;nbsp;irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a long-standing bug (people were complaining about this &lt;a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/4109/how-do-i-increase-the-resize-margin-on-windows"&gt;in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, seven years ago!), which has been fixed in Ubuntu proper for a long time, but has resurfaced in Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt;. Anyway, to fix resizing of windows, you need to enable Compiz in Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt;; that replaces Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s standard &amp;#8220;window manager&amp;#8221;, which is named &amp;#8220;Marco&amp;#8221;, with the Compiz window manager, and Compiz doesn&amp;#8217;t have this daft problem. Yes, it is annoying that this doesn&amp;#8217;t just work, and apparently they&amp;#8217;re working on fixing it so it doesn&amp;#8217;t become our problem as users to fix the deficiencies, but in the interim you can at least fix it for yourself even though you shouldn&amp;#8217;t have&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; Tweak, which is in the &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt; menu (&lt;strong&gt;Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Look and Feel&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;), and under &lt;em&gt;Windows&lt;/em&gt;, choose &lt;em&gt;Compiz (Advanced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; accelerated desktop effects)&lt;/em&gt; under &lt;em&gt;Window Manager&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://kryogenix.org/random/ubuntu-mate-enable-compiz.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, Compiz requires a 3d accelerated graphics card. However, unless your machine is very, very, very old indeed, it will have enough 3d acceleration to do this; this is not like playing games or similar. My ancient Dell laptop copes with it fine, so it should not be a&amp;nbsp;worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; will then switch to Compiz (you don&amp;#8217;t need to reboot or anything) and will show you a window saying &amp;#8220;Keep this window manager?&amp;#8221; If you see that window, you can click &amp;#8220;Yes, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; in it. (If for some reason this hasn&amp;#8217;t worked, then you won&amp;#8217;t see that window and so it will automatically switch back, so your computer isn&amp;#8217;t broken.) Now, resizing Ubuntu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATE&lt;/span&gt; windows should be a lot easier, because the resize grab area will not be one single&amp;nbsp;pixel.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2017 13:44:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-04-01:2017/04/01/enable-compiz-in-ubuntu-mate-to-fix-dragging-the-window-borders/</guid></item><item><title>Let’s Encrypt and TSOHost</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/02/25/lets-encrypt-and-tsohost/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This site used Cloudflare, because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; is hard and my host wanted to charge me money for a certificate.

&lt;blockquote cite="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix/"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[T]he operatives use their phones to record about two dozen spins on a [slot machine] they aim to cheat. They upload that footage to a technical staff in St. Petersburg, who analyze the video and calculate the machine’s pattern based on what they know about the model’s pseudorandom number generator. Finally, the St. Petersburg team transmits a list of timing markers to a custom app on the operative’s phone; those markers cause the handset to vibrate roughly 0.25 seconds before the operative should press the spin&amp;nbsp;button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timed spins are not always successful, but they result in far more payouts than a machine normally awards: Individual scammers typically win more than $10,000 per&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Scarne&amp;#8217;s Complete Guide to Gambling&lt;/em&gt;, published 1974, on the &amp;#8220;Rhythm Boys&amp;#8221; scam from&amp;nbsp;1949:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During 1949 a couple of thousand rhythm players, most of whom were women, were beating the slots all over Nevada and various other sections of the country. Hundreds were barred from the slot rooms, and slander suits (which were later dropped) were filed by some of the barred players. My findings show that national slot machine revenue took a real nose dive, dropping, from the 1948 figure of $700 million to a rockbottom low of $200 million in 1949. The rhythm players beat the slots during 1949 for half a billion&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How did the original mysterious stranger happen to come up with his bright idea? And who was he? I did some further detective work and discovered that he was an Idaho farmer who, during his spare time, had been helping a slot-mechanic friend repair out-of-order machines. He discovered that the three wheels in certain makes of machine made exactly the same number of revolutions when the handle was pulled. He studied the clock fan which controls the length of time the reels spin and found that on some machines the clock went dead from seven to eight seconds after the reels stopped spinning. He also memorized the position of each symbol on each reel. In actual play, since he knew the relative positions on the reel of all the symbols, he could deduce from the nine visible symbols he could see through the window just where all the others were. Then, by timing himself to pull the machine&amp;#8217;s level at precisely the right instant and before the clock gear went dead, he found that he could manipulate the desired symbols onto the pay line. Most of the rhythm players who learned the system later could, as a rule, control only the cherry on the first reel, but even that was good enough to empty the payoff coin tube; it just took a little&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything old is new again. Including exploiting insufficiently-random random-number-generators to make money in&amp;nbsp;Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 10:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-02-25:2017/02/25/fruit-machine-hacking/</guid></item><item><title>A standard password change API</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/02/24/a-standard-password-change-api/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice if there were some sort of standard password-change &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that websites all implemented? Then when there’s some sort of breach and you have to change a bunch of passwords&lt;sup id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="this week it was Cloudflare, but there’ll be another next week no doubt" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you could just download a list of domains that need fixing and give it to your password manager, and then your password manager would use the standard password-change &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; on each of those sites to change your password to something else. Literally one click; instead of reading stern concerned messages from everyone on Twitter saying “you should change your passwords now!” one can just click one button and, bish bash bosh, job done. That’d be lovely. Maybe Chrome’s password manager would build it in and automatically fetch sites that need updating from a central list and then I’d be secured without even knowing about it!&lt;sup id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="and a bunch of people would turn this off or never turn it on, but that’s fine, and they’re probably using some different manager already anyway" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-a-standard-password-change-api-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about people without a password manager?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, they’re no better off under this plan. But they’re no worse off. And they were likely already using guessable passwords. This problem needs fixing, certainly (have people use password managers, make them easier to use, eliminate passwords entirely, many other suggestions) but fixing it is not the goal of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does the password manager know where to look?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put a file in &lt;a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/795467/for-what-is-the-well-known-folder"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/.well-known&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which describes the location of the endpoint and the parameters that need to be passed to it or something. That seems an easy problem to solve; your password manager knows the domain, so it just hits &lt;code&gt;https://domain/.well-known/password-change.json&lt;/code&gt; and gets &lt;code&gt;{location: '/std-pwchange', required_parameters: {username: "username", password: "password"}}&lt;/code&gt; or something. The detail here can be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Doesn’t this make compromising people’s accounts easier?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; so, but I might be wrong. At the moment, if I discover your master password I can’t do anything with it without access to your password manager’s database; if I’ve got both your master password &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; access to your passwords database then I can manually go and steal all your accounts everywhere and change all your passwords. Having this doesn’t make it more likely; it just makes it less drudge-work for an attacker to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about sites that require two-factor auth?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this won’t work for them. Then again, if the site requires two-factor auth, having your password potentially compromised in a breach is not as big a deal, right? So the endpoint can return &lt;code&gt;needs-manual-update&lt;/code&gt; and then your password manager pops up a box saying “you have to manually update your password on the following sites: (list of links)”. Which is what it would do for sites that inexplicably have not adopted this idea anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why would anyone adopt this?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same reason anyone adopts anything; it seems a good plan, or everyone else is.

&lt;p&gt;Have I missed a reason why this would be a bad idea? It’d need speccing out in detail, obviously, but the concept to me seems good…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; there’s been a suggestion of one possible spec for such an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;a href="https://github.com/SirCmpwn/pass-rotate/issues/1"&gt;https://github.com/SirCmpwn/pass-rotate/issues/1&lt;/a&gt; for someone who wants to check it out.

But, three years in, I think I’ve finally actually understood in my own mind the difference between a dividend and a director withdrawal. My accountant, Crunch&lt;sup id="sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="who are really handy, online, and are happy to receive emails in which I ask stupid questions over and over again: if you need an accountant too, this referral link will get us both some money off" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have me record both of them when I take money out of the company, and I didn’t really get why until recently. When I finally got it, I wrote myself a note that I could go back to and read when I get confused again, and I thought I’d publish that here so others can see it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Important note: this is not financial advice.&lt;/strong&gt; If my understanding here differs from your understanding, trust yourself, or your accountant. I’m also likely glossing over many subtleties, etc, etc. If you think this is downright &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, I’d be interested in hearing. If you think it’s over-simplified, you’re doubtless correct.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dividend is a promise to pay you X money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A director withdrawal is you taking that money out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when a pound comes in, you can create a dividend to say: we’ll pay Stuart 80p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take the money out, you record a director withdrawal of 80p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividends are IOUs. Withdrawals are you cashing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the “director’s loan account is overdrawn”, that means: you have recorded dividends of N but have recorded director withdrawals of more than N, i.e., you’ve taken out more than the company wants to pay you. This may be because you are owed the amount you took, and recorded director withdrawals for all that but forgot to do a dividend for it, or because you’ve taken more than you’re allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a new dividend (in Crunch) it will (usefully) say what the maximum dividend you can take is; that should be the maximum takeable &lt;em&gt;while still leaving enough money in the account to pay the tax bill&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pay Yourself dashboard (in Crunch) it’ll say “money owed to Stuart”; that’s money that’s been promised with a dividend but not taken out with a withdrawal. (Note: this may be because you forgot to do a withdrawal for money you’ve taken! In theory it would mean money promised with a dividend but not taken, but maybe you took it and just didn’t do a withdrawal to record that you took it. Check.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1"&gt;who are really handy, online, and are happy to receive emails in which I ask stupid questions over and over again: if you need an accountant too, &lt;a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk/referrals/?c2c=sl14342l"&gt;this referral link&lt;/a&gt; will get us both some money off &lt;a class="simple-footnote-back" href="#sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-02-20:2017/02/20/dividends-and-director-withdrawals/</guid></item><item><title>The Quiet Voice</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/02/19/the-quiet-voice/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s harder to find news these days. On the one hand, there&amp;#8217;s news everywhere you turn. Shrieking at you. On the other, we&amp;#8217;re each in a bubble. Articles are rushed out to get clicks; everything&amp;#8217;s got a political slant in one direction or another. This is not new. But it does feel like it&amp;#8217;s getting&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s being recognised, though. Buzzfeed have just launched a thing called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/helping-you-see-outside-your-bubble"&gt;Outside Your Bubble&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, an admirable effort to &amp;#8220;give our audience a glimpse at what&amp;#8217;s happening outside their own social media spaces&amp;#8221;; basically, it&amp;#8217;s a list of links to views for and against at the bottom of certain articles. Boris Smus just wrote up an idea to &lt;a href="http://smus.com/headlines-meet-sparklines-news-in-context/"&gt;add easily-digestible sparkline graphs to news articles which provide context to the numbers quoted&lt;/a&gt;. There have long been services like &lt;a href="http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/"&gt;Channel 4&amp;#8217;s FactCheck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.allsides.com"&gt;AllSides&lt;/a&gt; which try to correct errors in published articles or give a balanced view of the news. Matt Kiser&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt; Just Happened Today&lt;/a&gt; tries to summarise, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/popular-newsletter-uses-open-source-techniques-cover-wtf-happening-trump/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Aside: I am bloody sure that there&amp;#8217;s an xkcd or similar about the idea of the quiet voice, where when someone uses a statistic on telly, the quiet voice says &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s actually only 2% higher than it was under the last president&amp;#8221; or something. But I cannot for the life of me find it.&amp;nbsp;Help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a thing I can install. A browser extension or something. And when I view an article, I get context and viewpoint on it. If the article says &amp;#8220;Trump&amp;#8217;s approval rating is 38%&amp;#8221;, the extension highlights it and says &amp;#8220;other sources say it&amp;#8217;s 45% (link)&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s a list of other presidents&amp;#8217; approval ratings at this point in their terms&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s a link to an argument on why it&amp;#8217;s this number&amp;#8221;. When the article says &amp;#8220;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t have enough trade negotiators to set up trade deals&amp;#8221; there&amp;#8217;s a link to an article claiming that that isn&amp;#8217;t a problem and explaining why. If it says &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; wait times are now longer than they&amp;#8217;ve ever been&amp;#8221; there&amp;#8217;s a graph showing what this response times are, and linking to a study showing that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; funding is dropping faster than response times are. An article saying that X billion is spent on foreign aid gets a note on how much that costs each taxpayer, what proportion of the budget it is, how much people think it is. It provides context, views from outside your bubble, left and right. You get to see what other people think of this and how they contextualise it; you get to see what quoted numbers mean and understand the background. It&amp;#8217;s not political one way or the other; it&amp;#8217;s like a wise aunt commentator, the quiet voice that says &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, here&amp;#8217;s what this means&amp;#8221; so you&amp;#8217;re better informed, of how it&amp;#8217;s relevant to you and what people outside your bubble&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#8217;s why it won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#8217;t work because it&amp;#8217;s a hysterical amount of effort and nobody has a motive to do it. It has to be almost instant; there&amp;#8217;s little point in brilliantly annotating an article three days after it&amp;#8217;s written when everyone&amp;#8217;s already read it. It&amp;#8217;d be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult for it to be non-partisan, and it&amp;#8217;d be even more difficult to make people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it was non-partisan even if it was. There&amp;#8217;s no money in it &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s explicitly not a thing that people go to, but lives on other people&amp;#8217;s sites. And there aren&amp;#8217;t browser extensions on mobile. The Washington Post offer something like this with their &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/16/now-you-can-fact-check-trumps-tweets-in-the-tweets-themselves/"&gt;service to annotate Trump&amp;#8217;s tweets&lt;/a&gt;, but extending it to all news articles everywhere is a huge amount of work. Organisations with a remit to do this sort of thing &amp;#8212; the &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/09/launching-an-independent-opennews-program/"&gt;newly-spun-off Open News&lt;/a&gt; from Mozilla and the Knight Foundation, say &amp;#8212; don&amp;#8217;t have the resources to do anything even approaching this. And it&amp;#8217;s no good if you have to pay for it. People don&amp;#8217;t really want opposing views, thoughts from outside their bubble, graphs and context; that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s caused this thing to need to exist in the first place! So it has to be trivial to add; if you demand money nobody will buy it. So I can&amp;#8217;t see how you pay the army of fact checkers and linkers your need to run this. It can&amp;#8217;t be crowd sourced; if it were then it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a reliable annotation source, it&amp;#8217;d be reddit, which would be disastrous. But it&amp;#8217;d be &lt;em&gt;so useful&lt;/em&gt;. And once it exists they can produce a thing which generates printable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; annotations and I can staple them inside my parents copy of the Daily&amp;nbsp;Mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 12:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-02-19:2017/02/19/the-quiet-voice/</guid></item><item><title>Niobium</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/30/niobium/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[41 is] the smallest integer whose reciprocal has a 5-digit repetend.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand a lot of things, these days. I don&amp;#8217;t understand what a 5-digit repetend is, or why 41 being a factor of 99999 has to do with anything. I don&amp;#8217;t understand &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/01/31/what-i-did-on-my-holidays/"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/01/30/temporarily-older-than-benedict-cumberbatch-for-six-months-again-dammit/"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/01/30/but-these-posts-go-to-eleven/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2013/01/30/thirty-seven-for-gods-sake-how-did-that-happen/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/01/30/a-year-goes-past/"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2011/01/31/brave-new-age/"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2009/01/30/mini-hippo-returns/"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2008/01/30/another-year-passes/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2007/01/30/my-week/"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/30/turning-thirty/"&gt;thirteen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2005/01/30/staring/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/31/birthdays/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2003/01/30/revolution/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t understand when building web stuff got hard. I don&amp;#8217;t understand why I can&amp;#8217;t find anyone who sells wall lights that look nice without charging a hundred notes for each one, which is a bit steep when you need six. I don&amp;#8217;t understand why I can&amp;#8217;t get thinner and still eat as many sandwiches as I want. I don&amp;#8217;t understand an awful lot of why the world suddenly became a terrible, frightening, mean-spirited, mocking, vitriolic place. And most of what I do understand about that, I&amp;nbsp;hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/"&gt;We all sorta thought&lt;/a&gt; that we were moving forward; there was less hatred of the Other, fewer knives out, not as much fear and spite as there used to be. And it turns out that it wasn&amp;#8217;t gone; it was just suppressed, building up and up underneath the volcano cap until the bad guys realised that there&amp;#8217;s nothing actually &lt;em&gt;stopping&lt;/em&gt; them doing terrible things and there&amp;#8217;s nothing anyone can do about it. So the Tories moved from daring to talk about shutting down the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; to actually doing it and nobody said anything. Or, more accurately, a bunch of people said things and it didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference. Trump starts restricting immigration and targeting Muslims directly and puts a Nazi adviser on the National Security Council and nobody said anything. Or, more accurately, a bunch of people said things and it didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference. I don&amp;#8217;t want to give in to hatred &amp;#8212; it leads to the Dark Side &amp;#8212; and so I don&amp;#8217;t want to hate them for doing this. But I do hate that I have to fight to avoid it. I hate that I feel so helpless. I hate that the only way I know to fight back is to actually fight &amp;#8212; to become &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. I hate that they turn everyone into malign, terrible copies of themselves. I hate that they don&amp;#8217;t understand. I hate that I don&amp;#8217;t understand. I hate that I just hate all the time&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m forty-one. Apparently, according to Wikipedia, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile nuclear submarines from the George Washington, Ethan Allen, Lafayette, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin classes were nicknamed &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41_for_Freedom"&gt;41 for Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. 41 for freedom. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s not a bad motto for me, being 41. Do more for freedom. My freedom, my family&amp;#8217;s freedom, my friends&amp;#8217; freedom, my city&amp;#8217;s freedom, people I&amp;#8217;ve never met and never will&amp;#8217;s freedom. &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/11/19/none-of-us-are-free/"&gt;None of us are free if one of us is chained&lt;/a&gt;, and if you don’t say it’s wrong then that says it&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is of Niamh, and her present to me for my birthday: a light box like the ones you get outside cinemas and churches and fast food places and we can put messages for one another on it. I&amp;#8217;m hugely pleased with it. The other is of &lt;a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/what-happened-donald-trump-protest-12530307"&gt;today&amp;#8217;s anti-Trump demo in Victoria Square&lt;/a&gt;, at which Reverend David Butterworth, of the Methodist Church, said: &amp;#8220;Whatever we can do to make this a more peaceful city and a more inclusive city, and to stand up and be counted, we must and should do it together. The only way that Donald Trump will win is if the good people of Birmingham, and of other cities that we’re twinned with like Chicago, stay silent.&amp;#8221; People standing up, and a demonstration of what they&amp;#8217;re standing up for. Not a bad way to start making me being 41 for freedom,&amp;nbsp;perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday to me. And for those of you less lucky than me today: I hope we can&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-01-30:2017/01/30/niobium/</guid></item><item><title>We all sorta thought</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A thing I wrote today, about Trump and Brexit and &amp;#8220;post-truth&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;alternative facts&amp;#8221; and helplessness, because I&amp;#8217;ve had this conversation separately three times&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;this is the thing. We all sorta thought (and by &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; I mean everyone from us here right back to, I dunno, Newton and Boyle) that if we provided inductive or deductive proof of a thing, that everyone else would say &amp;#8220;oh yeah, I&amp;#8217;m convinced now!&amp;#8221; and that&amp;#8217;d be it. But people who don&amp;#8217;t want that to happen have learned that attacking the evidence doesn&amp;#8217;t work &amp;#8212; it took them a few hundred years to learn that, but they did &amp;#8212; but dismissing the whole idea as illegitimate does work. And we don&amp;#8217;t know how to argue against that. I say two and two are four; you disagree; I say &amp;#8220;no look here&amp;#8217;s the proof&amp;#8221;; you say &amp;#8220;your methods of proof are wrong and biased&amp;#8221;; and then I&amp;#8217;m all, er, I don&amp;#8217;t know what to say now, you were meant to be convinced by the proof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

more importantly: a third party, looking at that conversation, goes away thinking &amp;#8220;well, is 2+2 equal to 4? Don&amp;#8217;t know; there seem to be two sides to that argument&amp;#8221;, or worse, &amp;#8220;man, I just don&amp;#8217;t care what 2+2 is because every time I try to find out there&amp;#8217;s just loads of shouting, so I&amp;#8217;ll stop asking&amp;#8221;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

and thus, modern politics. Gaslighting and obfuscation, designed to make people believe that facts are disputable and that engagement is confusing and annoying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(Of course, part of the problem here is that our side have a habit of declaring things to be an actual fact when they&amp;#8217;re really &amp;#8220;what we want to believe&amp;#8221;, and once one&amp;#8217;s cried wolf that way a few times, one&amp;#8217;s credibility is gone and it&amp;#8217;s really hard to get back. It&amp;#8217;s not all the other side&amp;#8217;s fault.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I wouldn&amp;#8217;t re-post such a thing, but of course this conversation happened on Slack, which means that six months from now I won&amp;#8217;t be able to link to this because it&amp;#8217;ll be over 10,000 messages ago and Slack will be holding it to ransom until we pay money, and five years from now I won&amp;#8217;t be able to link to it because Slack will have gone bust or have been sold to someone and shut&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-01-26:2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/</guid></item></channel></rss>
