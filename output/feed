We talked about performance, and how if your page contains &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; then your users see your interface sooner. About fallbacks, and how if you&amp;#8217;re on a train with a dodgy 3g connection the site should work and that&amp;#8217;s a competitive advantage for you, because your competitors&amp;#8217; sites probably don&amp;#8217;t. About isomorphic JavaScript and how the promise of it is that your Angular website won&amp;#8217;t have to wait until it&amp;#8217;s all downloaded before showing anything. About Opera Mini&amp;#8217;s 250 million users. It&amp;#8217;s about whether the stuff you build is available to the most people. About your reach, and you being able to reach more than the&amp;nbsp;others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we&amp;#8217;ve called this &amp;#8220;progressive enhancement&amp;#8221;, but people don&amp;#8217;t like that word. Because it sounds hard. It sounds like you&amp;#8217;re not allowed to use modern tools in case one user has &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE4&lt;/span&gt;. Like you have to choose between slick design and theoretical users in&amp;nbsp;Burma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much rhetorical use has been made of the &lt;a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/"&gt;gov.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; team&amp;#8217;s results of people not getting the script on their pages&lt;/a&gt;. The important part of that result was that 0.9% of visits didn&amp;#8217;t run the client side scripting even though they should have done. It&amp;#8217;s not people with JavaScript turned off, it with browsers that don&amp;#8217;t run it at all. Did you open a hundred web pages yesterday? I probably did. So for every hundred web pages opened by someone, one of them didn&amp;#8217;t work. Maybe they were in a tunnel and the 3g cut out. Maybe they were on hotel WiFi. Maybe the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; went down for ten seconds. Maybe the assets server crashed. But, for whatever reason, some of your site didn&amp;#8217;t work. Did that make your site &lt;em&gt;unavailable&lt;/em&gt; to them? Not if it was written right, written to be&amp;nbsp;available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &amp;#8220;written right&amp;#8221; does not mean that you have double the work to build a version of your WebGL photo editor that works in Lynx. If you do this by having isomorphic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;, so your node server provides &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; which makes your pages load before your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2MB&lt;/span&gt; of bower &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; arrives, that&amp;#8217;s fine. Because you&amp;#8217;re available to everybody; a Macbook user in a cafe, a finance director on her Windows desktop, a phone-using tween in a field with no coverage, and yes even Opera Mini users in&amp;nbsp;Burma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not about giving up your frameworks to cater for fictional example users with scripting disabled. It is true that &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html"&gt;not everyone has &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that sometimes that&amp;#8217;s you, so let&amp;#8217;s work out how to do this without regressing to&amp;nbsp;1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m not going to be talking about progressive enhancement any more. I&amp;#8217;m going to be talking about availability. About reach. About my web apps being for everyone even when the universe tries to stop&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2015 15:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-06-28:2015/06/28/availability/</guid></item><item><title>A review of Neal Stephenson’s Seveneves</title><link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/06/14/a-review-of-neal-stephensons-seveneves/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://www.badvoltage.org"&gt;Bad Voltage&lt;/a&gt; we review things: normally technology products, but occasionally other stuff that we like. In &lt;a href="http://www.badvoltage.org/1x44"&gt;the most recent show&lt;/a&gt; I reviewed Neal Stephenson&amp;#8217;s recently-released book &lt;em&gt;Seveneves&lt;/em&gt;, and I thought I&amp;#8217;d excerpt the review for here to give it a more permanent home for people who want to read&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.oOo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neal Stephenson isn&amp;#8217;t good at endings. Anyone who&amp;#8217;s read any of his stuff knows this. He is good at ideas, and they&amp;#8217;re what his books are about. The Diamond Age wasn&amp;#8217;t about its plot, it was about nanotechnology. Anathem was about Platonic epistemology. And Seveneves is about orbital&amp;nbsp;mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the moon blows up. Nobody&amp;#8217;s very sure why. Because this is sci-fi rather than a Michael Bay film, the moon isn&amp;#8217;t instantly vapourised into nothingness; all the rock is still there, so instead of a moon you&amp;#8217;ve got a cloud of boulders the size of the moon, drifting around where the moon was. Then a popular scientist bloke on Earth, who is called Dubois Harris but really ought to be called Duneil DeGrasse Tyson, points out that all those rocks that make up the moon are going to come out of orbit and land on the earth. Specifically, earth is going to spend five thousand years being bombarded by rocks from the sky, which will cause some problems. Specifically specifically, it will destroy everything. Everybody&amp;#8217;s dead, everybody is dead, everybody&amp;#8217;s dead,&amp;nbsp;Dave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the plan is set to stick a few thousand chosen people on the international space station so they survive and humanity continues to exist, in the two years before rocks fall and everyone dies. That&amp;#8217;s the first third of the book. There are some quite emotional scenes of people singing in St. Paul&amp;#8217;s Cathedral as the bombardment starts; Stephenson glosses over but makes you aware of the unbelieveable Niagara of politics which is going on back on Earth to decide who gets to live and who doesn&amp;#8217;t. The second third of the book is the story of these last remaining humans up in space, and this is where the orbital mechanics comes in; loving, pages-deep detail is devoted to how the international space station rotates its angle of perigee and moves to a higher plane of rotation or something. I have no idea whether this is true or not, but I assume it is. In American Psycho (the book, that is), Bret Easton Ellis went into huge stupid detail about the cravats and suits and pocket squares that the characters all wear, but secretly if anyone had actually worn the things he described they&amp;#8217;d have looked stupid&amp;#8230; because Ellis knew that everyone reading would just gloss over the actual brand names and have a picture in their heads of a bunch of jumped-up 80s yuppies. It is possible that what Stephenson describes is actually the space station doing insane loop-the-loops, as some sort of extremely erudite joke on the reader destined only for the astronauts among us. This is not helped by how the International Space Station gets re-christened&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Izzy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, those of you who are imagining that this becomes some sort of peace-and-flowers Star Trek world where everyone comes together would probably be better off reading something else. It&amp;#8217;s basically Lord of the Flies but in space. Now why didn&amp;#8217;t I see that coming? Oh, wait, I did. It&amp;#8217;s all quite believeably told, mind you, even if I just couldn&amp;#8217;t bear to actually read a chapter or two in the middle where a venial ex-President incites a schism. And we end up with there being only seven woman left from the cast of thousands, and everybody else is dead.&amp;nbsp;Dave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third part of the book is&amp;#8230; five thousand years later. Humanity has recovered and built cities in space and is returning to the earth&amp;#8230; and is divided into seven separate tribes, based on which of the seven Eves they descended from. It&amp;#8217;s all rather Brave New World in feel, assuming that Huxley had stopped every two pages to lovingly describe how a space elevator works. And then it ends. Anathem had a proper ending, so Stephenson is getting better at this stuff, but Seveneves backslides a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all rather 60s sci-fi in approach. Back when the star of the story was some cool new idea you had about space, like solar sails or geosynchronous satellites or whatever, and the ridiculous lantern-jawed spacer hero was really only there to stand around and explain the cool physics. Seveneves is like that. If you like that sort of thing, you&amp;#8217;ll like this. If you like Stephenson, you&amp;#8217;ll like this. If you like space engineering, you&amp;#8217;ll like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad Voltage verdict? If you like things like this, you&amp;#8217;ll like this thing. Especially if you already know what a perihelion&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2015 11:48:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-06-14:2015/06/14/a-review-of-neal-stephensons-seveneves/</guid></item><item><title>It also checks its JavaScript</title><link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/06/01/it-also-checks-its-javascript/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site does make (fairly heavy) use of JavaScript. It attempts to do it in a transparent and generally nice way, so as to not impede the progress of non-JavaScript aware browsers, or people who don&amp;#8217;t like client-side scripting. You should also not be seriously inconvenienced when viewing this site without JavaScript, since the features that it adds are merely aids to navigation (or pointless chrome, depending on who you talk to :-)
With regards to colour schemes, the images and colours should degrade sufficiently down to 256 colours without a problem at all. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what they will look like in 16 colours; possibly horrible. If they do, I apologise.
This site uses (as far as I know) no browser specific tags. It also checks its JavaScript; it should work fine in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE3&lt;/span&gt; and Netscape 2 as well as higher versions by degrading its JavaScript calls through different versions, and, as mentioned above, JavaScript is not required for anything on the site.
I did, at one point, consider having differing versions of this site; one for JavaScript aware browsers, and one not. However, that means mirroring information, unless you deprive the low-bandwidth people of some of the information that is available in the other site, and that defeats the object entirely. So, this site, as mentioned above, degrades well (I believe).
If there&amp;#8217;s one thing I really dislike, it&amp;#8217;s seeing the phrase &amp;#8220;This site best viewed with&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;is required to view this site&amp;#8221; somewhere on a web page. Now, I&amp;#8217;m the first to admit that there may be problems with this site about which I do not know; I&amp;#8217;m not being deliberately hypocritical. (If you find that there&amp;#8217;s a problem with displaying some aspect of this site, I&amp;#8217;d appreciate it if you could email me and tell me about it; the address is on the personal page.) But optimising your site with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE&lt;/span&gt; or Netscape specific features, like (say) floating frames, or JavaScript 1.3, is a poor showing indeed. I have no objections to people who want to only make a feature available to (say) Netscape users, but please, please use JavaScript, or an Active Server Page, or a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; script, to check your viewer&amp;#8217;s browser and transparently offer it to them. Don&amp;#8217;t tell me that I&amp;#8217;m missing features, just because I haven&amp;#8217;t got the latest version of the latest browser; just show me everything I need to see. And don&amp;#8217;t, especially don&amp;#8217;t, make navigation or use of your site depend on these &amp;#8216;optional&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;features!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;#8217;t think that use of your site should depend on&amp;nbsp;JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don&amp;#8217;t have to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt; any more,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 08:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-06-01:2015/06/01/it-also-checks-its-javascript/</guid></item><item><title>Disputing a BS YouTube copyright claim</title><link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/05/30/disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up to an email from YouTube saying that some music company had claimed I used their music without a licence in one of my videos, and so I would no longer be able to monetise that video.&lt;sup id="sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="The ads still run, it’s just that they get the money now." href="#sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-1" class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hi Stuart Langridge, Due to a copyright claim, you are no longer monetising the following YouTube video. It is still playable on YouTube, but the copyright owner could choose to show ads on it. Video title: Potton in 2012: a video drive around. Copyrighted song: Can't Get Away. Claimed by: [Merlin] Awal UK Limited. Why this can happen: Your video might contain copyrighted content. A copyright claim on a video can prevent you from monetising it. The YouTube Team" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-2652.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hang on, thought I. That’s &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/04/09/potton-in-2012-a-video-drivearound/"&gt;the video where Dad and I drove up every street in Potton&lt;/a&gt;. Didn’t I use Creative Commons music for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes I did. It was &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/austingraver/background-elevator-music-loop"&gt;“Background Elevator Music (Loop-able) by Austin Graver&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id="sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="not the most inspiring piece of music, but that was the idea" href="#sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-2" class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; used under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, and that’s explicitly called out both in the YouTube description of the video and in the credits in the video itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-2941.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I follow the “View Claim Details” link and get told that “your video may include music that is owned by a third party”, which it does not, and I assume that some sort of automatic Shazam-like robot downloaded the video, incorrectly matched it against its list of owned music, and mechanically filed the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-3022.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I then get a link to &lt;strong&gt;file a dispute&lt;/strong&gt;. Which gets a bit confusing: I’m then asked &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I’m filing a dispute, and presented with a little menu of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-3126.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are hilarious: “I believe that this copyright claim is not valid, because &lt;em&gt;I own the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; or bought the song online&lt;/em&gt;“, and “because… &lt;em&gt;I gave credit in the video&lt;/em&gt;“. I’m assuming that these are some YouTube lawyer’s equivalent of the pit trap in &lt;em&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/em&gt; where you inadvertently click “because… &lt;em&gt;I’m not selling the video&lt;/em&gt;” and then they strap you into a chair and spend thirty minutes lecturing you about how Copyright Does Not Work That Way, you filthy music thief. Anyway, I deftly avoid these obvious routes to death: what I want is an option which says “the music you say is in here is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in here, you stupid robot”. That ought to be enough; as it happens, I can prove that I have the right to use the music that I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; use, but that’s not in question; they’ve accused me of using their copyrighted music, and I didn’t. There is no option for that. There’s nothing on the list of choices for why I’m disputing the claim which indicates that the claim is irrelevant rather than disputable. Pander to the licence holders much, YouTube? Anyway, from the list, “I have a licence or written permission from the proper rights holder to use this material” seems like the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reason for dispute: This video uses the copyrighted material at issue, but with the appropriate licence or written permission from the copyright owner." src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-3415.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BZZT&lt;/span&gt;. No! You see there where it says “This video uses the copyrighted material at issue”? My video does not. This dispute reason means “yep, I am using your music, but I’m allowed”. I’m not using their music at all. So this is not the right path. Other options from the menu of choices are “My use of the content meets the legal requirements for fair use or fair dealing under applicable copyright laws” and “The content is in the public domain or is not eligible for copyright protection”, both of which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; start from a proviso of “yep, I used your music”, which is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only one remaining is “The video is my original content and I own all of the rights to it.” Which is not true either! It’s not my original content; the music is Austin Graver’s original content, which he allowed me to use. What it isn’t, Awal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Limited, is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; music. YouTube don’t even seem to acknowledge anywhere that a copyright claim might be made erroneously, that I might look at a video of ducks on a river and say “hey! that video contains Sympathy For The Devil! Give me money!” when it absolutely does not. I should not have to prove that the music in the video is allowed — if it’s not, then that’s for the rightful copyright holder to dispute. If you claim my video contains your music and my video does not, then I should be able to say “my video does not contain the thing you’re complaining about” and that’s it. Come on, Google, sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as ever, I don’t want to get my Google account suspended or something while I fight this out. So I wrote a reason for dispute which not only said “this is not your music” but explained why I was allowed to use the music that I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The music in this video is not the song 'Can't Get Away' as suggested in the copyright claim. The music is the track 'Background Elevator Music (Loop-able)' by Austin Graver, available from (soundcloud link) and published under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. This information is explicitly placed in the video description on YouTube, and is also in the credits section at the end of the video itself. I therefore state that the copyright claim against this video is invalid because the video does not contain the material that the claimant suggests it does." src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/ytcopyrightbs/ytcbs-4613.png" class="centre-shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very annoying. Surely if I just log into YouTube and incorrectly challenge a bunch of videos for containing my copyrighted music when they don’t, there would be some repercussions? Some sort of punishment for me? Why does this not apply to them? The whole process is designed to make me feel like I have to humbly ask for permission, like Oliver Twist; sure, if I’d stuck a Beatles song on the soundtrack then I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have to humbly beg permission, but I didn’t, and assuming &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that everyone &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seems more oppressive than it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ll see what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-1"&gt;The ads still &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just that they get the money now. &lt;a href="#sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-2"&gt;not the most inspiring piece of music, but that was the idea &lt;a href="#sf-disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2015 10:16:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-05-30:2015/05/30/disputing-a-bs-youtube-copyright-claim/</guid></item><item><title>Unhappy about SPA frameworks</title><link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/05/24/unhappy-about-spa-frameworks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at single-page-app frameworks and not keen on any of them. The list at http://todomvc.com/ has a bunch, and I think I&amp;#8217;ve rejected them all &amp;#8212; I concede that some of these reasons are just flat-out prejudice or reasonably baseless bad feelings or seem pretty trivial to whoever&amp;#8217;s reading, so this is your chance to talk me into something you think is good and show me why my bad feelings are unjustified or&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;d like is two-way data binding, routing, and some notion of making separate isolated components. I don&amp;#8217;t have a pure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; put/delete/get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to back end onto, and I do not want a &amp;#8220;framework&amp;#8221; which has as a selling point that you can switch different routing or template components in and out; if I&amp;#8217;m assembling my own preferences out of bits, then I won&amp;#8217;t use a framework at all; I&amp;#8217;ll stitch them together myself. The point of using a framework is exactly that it does everything, and I&amp;#8217;m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with using the framework&amp;#8217;s methods to do X, Y, and Z, rather than cursing because I want to use a different routing library. I am a large believer in identifying the approach that a particular tool takes, and not using the tool if what you want to do doesn&amp;#8217;t match that approach, even if it&amp;#8217;s possible to use the tool in ways other than its expected that you will. Every time I&amp;#8217;ve done this in the past I&amp;#8217;ve ended up being burned by it. The thing I want is to identify something which wants to do the things I plan, and then use it; not to find something which doesn&amp;#8217;t want to work that way and then make it work that way&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, convince me I&amp;#8217;m wrong on your preferred choice from this list, or mention something I don&amp;#8217;t know about. And yes, I could write my own, but I&amp;#8217;m massively resistant to that because that just makes the another-day-another-framework problem even&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one non-negotiable rule: JavaScript. No other languages which compile to JavaScript. I don&amp;#8217;t mind things like React&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSX&lt;/span&gt;, because that&amp;#8217;s being used to write &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; (although I&amp;#8217;m not sure about it), but no Coffeescript libraries,&amp;nbsp;please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/em&gt; - also requires underscore and jquery. Some ideal thing for this really ought to be self-contained. Concerned about &amp;#8220;is pre-configured to sync with a RESTful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; too, and I have to plug in my own choice of templating&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AngularJS&lt;/em&gt; - used it in the past for things. It makes me sad. There&amp;#8217;s too much magic; it&amp;#8217;s fine until something doesn&amp;#8217;t work, and then you have to reverse-engineer all the&amp;nbsp;magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ember.js&lt;/em&gt; - is massive and confuses the hell out of me. I did a bit of hacking on Discourse, which is Ember, and it took me about a day just to work out how to change the simplest&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;KnockoutJS&lt;/em&gt; - seems way, way verbose. &lt;code&gt;function AppViewModel() { this.firstName = ko.observable("Bert"); this.fullName = ko.computed(function() { ... }, this); } ko.applyBindings(new AppViewModel());&lt;/code&gt;, seriously? Gnah. I hate&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dojo&lt;/em&gt; - old. I never liked it the first time around, really, and I have the feeling that the zeitgeist has not gone with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - old, and pretty much abandoned upstream afaik. Used it at Canonical; &amp;#8220;aspect-oriented programming&amp;#8221; is basically computed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; from Intercal, which puts invisible trapdoors in your code so following the thread of control is hell on&amp;nbsp;legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockback.js&lt;/em&gt; - builds on Knockout, so see&amp;nbsp;knockout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;CanJS&lt;/em&gt; - models stuff seems specifically designed to back end to a put/get/delete rest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, which I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polymer&lt;/em&gt; - seems like it may be ropy on iOS. Also, it has a nice big library of pre-built components, which is great, but they&amp;#8217;re all Material Design components, which is not great at all; I&amp;#8217;m not putting an Android-themed app on other platforms, for the same reason I wouldn&amp;#8217;t put an app which looks like iOS on&amp;nbsp;Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;React&lt;/em&gt; - I fear React. It seems to be the popular thing, but it&amp;#8217;s very much a thing where one steps out of the world and into the React World instead. Have spoken to a number of people using it for real projects and I don&amp;#8217;t like the idea of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mithril&lt;/em&gt; - I utterly utterly do not understand the &lt;code&gt;m.prop&lt;/code&gt; stuff. I don&amp;#8217;t know whether the docs explain it badly or I&amp;#8217;m just not getting it, but I completely cannot grasp the Zen of Mithril. Shame, because it looks cool, if I could get it, which I&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ampersand&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in two minds about the &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s a zillion small libraries&amp;#8221; thing. More to the point, I have no sense of how to structure the overall application; individual bits I can see how to do, but I don&amp;#8217;t have a good sense of how to put it&amp;nbsp;together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m not sure this is the right thing for new apps. For restructuring an existing thing, I think it&amp;#8217;d be good, but I&amp;#8217;m building from&amp;nbsp;scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vue.js&lt;/em&gt; - doesn&amp;#8217;t do routing or provide large-scale structure; they have some notes saying &amp;#8220;hey, that means you can do it your way&amp;#8221; which I don&amp;#8217;t want to&amp;nbsp;do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;MarionetteJS&lt;/em&gt; - depends on Backbone, so see&amp;nbsp;Backbone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;TroopJS + RequireJS&lt;/em&gt; - lots of dependencies. I do not get how to actually structure an application with it, and the docs are not helpful at&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I were happy about any of these. To be honest, my secret worry is that all frameworks are either incomplete, so I don&amp;#8217;t want them, or do do everything I want but are consequentially too magical and so I don&amp;#8217;t like them. I hope I&amp;#8217;m wrong and there&amp;#8217;s either something I&amp;#8217;ve missed or a framework I don&amp;#8217;t know about.

You see, &lt;a href="http://omgubuntu.com"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+joeysneddon/posts/4g1pwF51Vfd"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;I wonder if &lt;a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/the-sands-of-time-linux-desktop"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; still&amp;nbsp;works?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/sandswall.jpg" alt="'The Sands of Time' Linux Desktop" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s quite cool &amp;#8212; sand dunes in front of a clock &amp;#8212; and it made me remember that years and years ago you used to get these programs where you could click and it would create sand which accumulated at the bottom of the window. The very first one I saw was on the Archimedes. But what came along a little later was one where you could click to produce various different substances &amp;#8212; sand, oil, water, fire &amp;#8212; and oil floated on water, fire set the oil alight, and so on. It was all rather amazing back when the phrase &amp;#8220;particle system&amp;#8221; hadn&amp;#8217;t been invented. Anyway, I thought: hey, what&amp;#8217;d be cool is if the clock in that picture was obscured by actual moving sand, rather than just a static picture of sand dunes. A tiny bit of poking around brought me to &lt;a href="http://dust.awevation.com/"&gt;Dust&lt;/a&gt;, an implementation of precisely the sand/oil/water thing with WebGL in the browser. So I completely forgot about the clock thing and just played with Dust. Which is rather&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some faffing around I discovered that it had two things I liked: &amp;#8220;lava&amp;#8221;, which is like a static piece of fire in that it ignites things that touch it but is not itself consumed, and &amp;#8220;Life Itself&amp;#8221; which is stuff that grows, like bacteria in a petri dish. But the life stuff is ignited by lava. so if you drop a couple of tiny bits of lava into the world, and then some green fungus life stuff, the fungus grows and takes over the whole window until it touches the lava, and then it gets burned up and vanishes&amp;#8230; but, critically for this, it isn&amp;#8217;t entirely consumed. A few specks remain, and those specks start growing again. Very cool. I spent ages just watching&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought, well, this is nice and all, but this Dust thing uses WebGL, which is hassle, and it can&amp;#8217;t actually cope with filling its whole window up with particles because it runs out of memory or space or shaders or something. So I figured I&amp;#8217;d lash together a quick version&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://sil.jsbin.com/zovumo/embed?output"&gt;Burning Trees on jsbin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lo, it is so: a noddy version in JavaScript. This is superbly inefficient; it regenerates the whole grid and then &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt;s it into the page at every clock tick, and it&amp;#8217;s completely character-based, like some sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; Micro program. (At least it&amp;#8217;s using &lt;code&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; so it doesn&amp;#8217;t hammer the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; in a background tab!) But I could still sit there and watch it for ages. I really like it; the sense of watching the green take over and then get burned&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what I&amp;#8217;d like to do with it is make it considerably more efficient and then try to make it a sort of &amp;#8220;live wallpaper&amp;#8221; for my Ubuntu desktop. For that, I need to read about Life rendering algorithms; &lt;a href="http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/"&gt;this Life implementation at pmav.eu&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; port of &lt;a href="http://dotat.at/prog/life/life.html"&gt;Tony Finch&amp;#8217;s List Life algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to do the calculations. There&amp;#8217;s also &lt;a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Golly&lt;/a&gt;, the Life simulator, which can do things ridiculously fast, and it&amp;#8217;s possible to program your own ruleset (rather than just follow John Conway&amp;#8217;s original rules), and if I understood how to do this (I do not) then I could probably turn my little Burning Trees thing into something that&amp;#8217;s renderable by Golly at a much bigger size than my inefficient JavaScript can manage. There seems to be a quite large community of people working on Life, still, to my amazement. Where do these people hang out, I wonder? So I can ask them how to write a Golly ruleset. And then see if I can make Golly run fullscreen and render to the root window and have the coolest desktop background imaginable, especially once it&amp;#8217;s graphics rather than block characters, and maybe the green is different colours depending on how old it is, and the fire has a slightly cooler effect, and&amp;#8230; well, you can see, I like this idea, so making it look pretty would be wonderful. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll even put a clock behind it. But if I did it&amp;#8217;d either be &lt;a href="http://sil.jsbin.com/mexuka"&gt;this one which I pinched from an imgur idea&lt;/a&gt; or my favourite clock that I wrote, which is&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://sil.jsbin.com/qafag/embed?output"&gt;Stuart&amp;#8217;s cool clock on jsbin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, none of this is what Joey wanted. Sorry, Joey. I hope the thing you wanted still works, even if it is &lt;em&gt;waaaay&lt;/em&gt; complex to set up. Someone should step up and make that easier for you, because I like it when we have pretty things, and there aren&amp;#8217;t enough of them on our&amp;nbsp;desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 00:58:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-05-20:2015/05/20/burning-trees/</guid></item><item><title>Your periodic reminder that</title><link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/05/14/your-periodic-reminder-that/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here are things, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22your%20periodic%20reminder%20that%22&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;Twitter people&lt;/a&gt;, of which you need to be periodically&amp;nbsp;reminded.&lt;/p&gt;

And I had a few things, which I felt should be recorded for posterity. There’s a lot of stuff I don’t like. But equally there’s quite a bit of stuff which I feel is a perfect shining jewel of the moment it was created; that it could not be improved; that I love it; that it’s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Doctor Who minimalist poster&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Allons-y" src="http://kryogenix.org/images/tennant-minimalist.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved this &lt;a href="http://www.blastr.com/2010/10/10_awesome_minimalist_doc.php"&gt;whole series of posters&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to have been originally done by &lt;a href="http://www.karmaorange.com/"&gt;Karma Orange&lt;/a&gt; although their link has died&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="Regret that I never bought one of these as an actual poster. Although I might get the Matt Smith one. Geronimo." href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-1" class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But this is properly fabulous. It makes me smile, just to know it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Roads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vg1jyL3cr60" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this song. People who have known me since university will be aware of this. &lt;em&gt;Dummy&lt;/em&gt; by Portishead is the finest album ever, and &lt;em&gt;Roads&lt;/em&gt; is the best song on it. Unusually, the above link is to a live version, because I actually think the live version is even better. Beth’s voice is perfection. Heartbreak. This song is the most wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hell’s Bells, live&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="270" src="//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x256bdh" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Hell’s Bells, by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, played live at River Plate&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="Yes I know I said that me liking live versions is unusual. You wouldn’t know it from this post, though." href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-2" class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you gave me a choice of any person, anywhere, that I could be, and I didn’t have to go back and kill Hitler or anything like that, I’d be Brian Johnson, swinging on the rope at River Plate. I’ve never seen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; live, and now I likely never will, but this is the finest gig there’s ever been. Look at the people. Hundreds of thousands of them. That must be something, feeling that wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Secret History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book by Donna Tartt. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Secret-History-Donna-Tartt/dp/0140167773"&gt;The Secret History&lt;/a&gt; was a story I first read — was first published — while I was at university. I’ve read much, both before and after it. I can name individual paragraphs from other books that I prefer. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSH&lt;/span&gt; is still, after all these years, my favourite book. That I can’t help but construe certain tragic similarities between Richard Papen and myself, to quote Francis, is where some of its appeal lies. And a day when I don’t quote the book or be influenced by it in some context is unusual, not that anyone else knows that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Assassin’s Creed Revelations E3 trailer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="236" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K39UWxdm0U" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never seen anything like this. When it was released I watched it over and over and over again. The soundtrack (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(Woodkid_song)"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; by Woodkid) is marvellous, and the video meshes with it ideally; this is not just some song they dropped into the trailer because they couldn’t find anything better. But it’s looking at it that I can hardly believe. It’s jaw-dropping. Look at Ezio’s hood when he’s pushed out onto the balcony, or Leandros’s skin. The trip across the desert, and perching on top of a mountain like Batman. Watch Ezio duck under a swung spear and then nut a guy with a metal helmet on. Better, watch him get shot in the shoulder, look around him like a hunted wolf, and then snap the arrow off. It is unbelieveable. The story, the characterisation, the graphics&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-3-back"&gt;&lt;a title="honest word? the bit where Ezio gets his head pulled off is the first part where he looks like a computer character. Uncanny Valley. Right up until then, he looks totally completely realistic. That tiny bit I find disappointing. But I pretend it isn’t there." href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-3" class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the music. Sure, the game wasn’t perfect, but the trailer is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Golden Leaves by Passenger&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="236" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytmLIv4TrUs" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve listened to a lot of music. &lt;em&gt;Hell’s Bells&lt;/em&gt; makes me feel happy. &lt;em&gt;Roads&lt;/em&gt; is like being stroked with fur gloves. But &lt;em&gt;Golden Leaves&lt;/em&gt;, and specifically &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; recording, done in Cambridge with an orchestra, is the concept of melancholy made material, for me. There’s something compelling about melancholy, a sweet langorous sense of feeling sorry for yourself or for everything and yet being touched by it. There’s not a note wrong, not a lyric misplaced, in this recording of this song. It is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preliator by Globus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5q6skxRLnsI" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, this is what I listen to when I want to feel heroic. I’ve never known a song like this. Listening to it makes me feel six inches taller. Like I could stand in the fire and be unharmed. Globus have taken the idea of huge, orchestral, imposing, world-shaking music which Wagner and Verdi had and redone it for modern times.&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-4-back"&gt;&lt;a title="fine, for film soundtracks, but you find your patrons where you can" href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-4" class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is hero music for everyone. I defy you to listen to it and not imagine yourself at the point of the lightning bolt, marching through the fields of enemy slain and laying all waste before you. What is good in life? This is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Zero Punctuation: Assassin’s Creed Unity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="236" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TB3DrTkVgHw" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like well-written comedy which also manages to be relevant to stuff I care about. We do that&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-5-back"&gt;&lt;a title="or at least try" href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-5" class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on Bad Voltage. The review sections are, at least to me, things that ought to be Zero Punctuation; Yahtzee fires a whole bunch of blanks at times, but when he gets it right he really really gets it right, and this particular review of a not-very-good game doesn’t put a single foot wrong. Describing the Assassin’s Creed backstory as the “yay downtrodden, boo aristos dynamic” is all of incisive, accurate, and terribly amusing. Arno just being Ezio 2.0 because he has a four-letter-name with an “O” on the end fits ideally into the rhythm. Inspired, every time I watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ants Go Marching In, hero version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe height="236" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0X3Me_MVR90" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know this tune as &lt;em&gt;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&lt;/em&gt;. I’d call it &lt;em&gt;The Animals Went In Two By Two&lt;/em&gt;. When Michael Kamen took it for &lt;em&gt;Die Hard With A Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; and made it into hero music, I could hardly believe it. Preliator is hero music for sweeping the battlefield with power. This, this is about being heroic in your actual life. It’s a kid’s song, made epic — made into the definition of the &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; epic — just by being well orchestrated. Think of the circularly marching students in &lt;em&gt;Dead Poets Society&lt;/em&gt; crossed with Scar’s &lt;em&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-6-back"&gt;&lt;a title="which very, very nearly made it onto this list itself, but it’s a villain song. It is perfect; Scar is not." href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-6" class="simple-footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is inspirational to a degree I can barely express in words. Six inches taller, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Lumps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perfection is finality. Finality is death. Nothing is perfect. There are lumps in it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s perfect? Go tell Dan Bull, and tell me. Link me what you think is perfect. Not just good, but perfect. Post it. We need more perfection in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-1"&gt;Regret that I never bought one of these as an actual poster. Although I might get the Matt Smith one. Geronimo. &lt;a href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-2"&gt;Yes I know I said that me liking live versions is unusual. You wouldn’t know it from this post, though. &lt;a href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-3"&gt;honest word? the bit where Ezio gets his head pulled off is the first part where he looks like a computer character. Uncanny Valley. Right up until then, he looks totally completely realistic. That tiny bit I find disappointing. But I pretend it isn’t there. &lt;a href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-4"&gt;fine, for film soundtracks, but you find your patrons where you can &lt;a href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-5"&gt;or at least try &lt;a href="#sf-things-that-are-perfect-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-things-that-are-perfect-6"&gt;which very, very nearly made it onto this list itself, but it’s a villain song.

Stuff I’m buying from websites, applications from an app store, pizzas from Dominos. This, the concept called “carrier billing” or “operator billing”, would be entirely possible if mobile phone carriers could do one inch of cooperation rather than sitting about wringing their hands about how Apple and Google are getting all the money. Of course they’re getting all the money; you lot would rather they got all the money than any competitor got a cent, and it’s going to kill your businesses and turn you into the dumb pipes that everyone wrongly thinks you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is how it should work. Carriers, pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: The Carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the carriers get together and create one service where people can pay for things on their mobile bill by just visiting a web page. This is the bit that has not happened; this stuff is theoretically possible (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSMA&lt;/span&gt; were doing tech demos of this sort of thing, conceptually, two years ago when I was at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MWC&lt;/span&gt;). Imagine they now have all done so, and this service is live at OneTrueMobilePayments.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: The Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, an app developer, make a mobile web app. I go to OneTrueMobilePayments.com and sign up, completely automatedly, fill in my bank details/paypal account/whatever, and get an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; key. Note that there was no requirement there to fill in a form and have a human review it, nor to sign a secret &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDA&lt;/span&gt;, nor to agree to a partnership deal with one specific carrier. Signing up for this should be like signing up for Google Adsense or Stripe or something. No secret deals. No signatures on bits of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: The User&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user comes to my website. I want to sell them some digital thing; a new avatar, let’s say. I construct the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;http://onetruemobilepayments.com/buy?item=NewAvatar&amp;amp;price=1GBP&amp;amp;apikey=ABCDEFG&lt;/code&gt; and direct the user’s browser to it. The user goes there, and that website recognises which carrier they’re on (because they’re on the carrier’s network and the carrier’s network knows that they’re connected to the onetruemobilepayments server, which is magic&lt;sup id="sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="this requires carrier cleverness, but it’s already doable; EE, here in the UK, will show me my current data usage just by visiting a URL, and I didn’t have to log in at all" href="#sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-1" class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and gives them a big button which says “buy this thing for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GBP&lt;/span&gt;”. Clicking that button redirects back to the web app with some sort of ?paid=yes thing; my web app then records that the payment was made, just like buying from paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there would need to be a bunch of cryptography and stuff in here to avoid forged requests, replay attacks, etc, but that’s all known science (paypal does it, oauth does it, etc). There is also the problem of “what if they’re on wifi”, which is indeed a problem for this plan but probably not insurmountable.&lt;sup id="sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="You say “sorry, disconnect from wifi and then hit refresh”, or you send them an SMS to the number they entered and they reply with “yes, pay it”, or something. There is complexity here, but if we can land a man on the moon, we can sort this out, for god’s sake." href="#sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-2" class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe onetruemobilepayments.com is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; a different server for every carrier and each carrier sets it differently in their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;. Dunno. There are plenty of smart tech people who can work out the best way to provide the slick user experience I describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there are two things missing from the above, and it’s really important that they &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is: the developer did not know anything about carriers. They signed up for the one service, and that all works. The developer did not have to sign separate deals with every carrier in every country; they did not have to register their bank account with every carrier in every country; they signed up for one api key from the service and that’s it. Now, sure, there are a whole bunch of financial and tax and whatnot implications here, but developers &lt;strong&gt;don’t care&lt;/strong&gt;. Solve that problem. Don’t outsource it to every developer in the world. Make this be an &lt;em&gt;easier way&lt;/em&gt; to get money for developers than the iTunes App Store is, and people will jump on it like wolves. Getting paid for stuff is currently irritating. Make it be not irritating. Make it be as simple as Stripe for your developers, and &lt;em&gt;way simpler than Stripe&lt;/em&gt; for the millions and millions of users. And then take 5% off each payment or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is: the user did not have to log in. They did not have to register a username and a password; they did not have to remember that password. My carrier knows which web pages I’m visiting. Use that information. My carrier knows how my phone is connected to the network. A web server operated by the carrier and plumbed into the carrier’s network can know who I am without having to ask. Use that. The user already has a financial relationship with their carrier; you don’t need to ask them for accounts and payment details. Use that. That makes the purchase experience totally slick. No passwords to remember. No initial hurdle of setting up a username. One click. Paid for. Done. That’s how you beat Google Wallet and Paypal, by taking advantage of the fact that you run the network and they don’t. They want carriers to be just dumb pipes — avoid that by being a &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; pipe which can deliver things that they cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The frustration, it burns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the first person to say all of this. This is all known concept in the carrier world. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSMA&lt;/span&gt; is a sort of steering-group-cum-industry-organisation who are there to help make this sort of cooperation happen. But their OneAPI project has closed; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAC&lt;/span&gt; never really got off the ground and got binned. Operators basically refuse to change any of their systems to do anything interoperable at all. And they don’t think that developer APIs are worth it, because every time an operator creates a set of developer APIs, nobody uses them. Because they insist that a developer sign up and sign an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDA&lt;/span&gt; before being able to read the documentation; that that developer then has to register with each carrier individually; that making a developer sign an agreement &lt;em&gt;specifically with you&lt;/em&gt; is more important than them actually getting stuff done, and every carrier would rather lose the business than cooperate with their competition. No developers will do all this. You, Mrs Operator, are not an important part of their business, not when they have to sign up with your 99 competitors as well. Nobody is going to set up a system where users get a slick experience &lt;em&gt;but only if they’re on T-Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. This is not competitive advantage for you. Stop thinking that it can be. But if you all get together then it is competitive advantage for operators as a whole over non-operators as a whole. It honestly feels like the “priority ordering” for operators is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something which makes us, our specific operator, win and every other operator lose, so that one day every mobile phone in the world uses us!&lt;sup id="sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-3-back"&gt;&lt;a title="insert maniacal laughter here" href="#sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-3" class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose and have Google and Apple and Stripe and Paypal get all the money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something which makes us and other operators all win big and Paypal lose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…that is, it is more important that your competition loses than that you win. This is stupid on a scale difficult to express in words. It is the Mount Everest of moronic business thoughts. Pack it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please build this. Please stop me having to type my credit card number in, or teach that credit card number to my browser, or sign up for a Paypal account. Carriers, &lt;em&gt;you could do this&lt;/em&gt;. All it needs is that you be prepared to cooperate, and that you work in the open and not only in secret back-room handshake partnership deals. Yes, this is a radical change to the way you do business. But in a world in which everyone’s on mobile, it means you get 3% of every transaction anyone makes anywhere, and it is a slick delightful experience to a degree that your non-carrier competition &lt;em&gt;cannot match&lt;/em&gt;. Do it. Make everyone love you. It’s much nicer than being hated, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-1"&gt;this requires carrier cleverness, but it’s already doable; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EE&lt;/span&gt;, here in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, will show me my current data usage just by visiting a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, and I didn’t have to log in at all &lt;a href="#sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-i-wish-i-could-pay-for-things-on-my-mobile-bill-2"&gt;You say “sorry, disconnect from wifi and then hit refresh”, or you send them an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; to the number they entered and they reply with “yes, pay it”, or something.

I don’t think I’m stupid&lt;sup id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="not all the time, anyway" href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-1" class="simple-footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I’m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="ish" href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-2" class="simple-footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at maths, and I play the lottery. This is why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, my desire for money is not linear, because I’m not &lt;em&gt;homo economicus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-3-back"&gt;&lt;a title="People aren’t identical and spherical, either" href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-3" class="simple-footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My laws of desire for money are more Einsteinian than Newtonian: linear desire for money works at &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amounts, but as they get higher it gets weird. I might desire £4 twice as much as £2, true enough; small amounts, Newton’s sensible laws. But I don’t desire £2 million twice as much as £1 million, because having a million would be enough and what would I do with the second million? I desire a million quite a lot more than a hundred times as much as £10,000, because a million quid is amazing and ten grand is a new car. The lottery gives me, for a negligible outlay, an outside chance of having a million quid, which would be radically life-changing (because I’d never have to work again). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no other way I’ll get a million pounds. Sure, my chances of winning the lottery are at pretty adverse odds (roughly, 1 in 14 million chance of winning; when I win I get somewhere in between 2 and 6 million pounds). But having a million quid is a goal I’d like to hit. I can attempt that with almost no work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that I wanted a million, and I started with a pound. Perhaps I should play roulette instead, which has a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more favourable edge than the lottery (although it’s still unfavourable; 5 &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;% for the bank and against me). So I stick my quid on black 17, and it comes up; a chance of 1/38, and I get £36 back for a total of £37. I let that £37 ride, and black 17 comes up again, so I now have £1369. Ride again&lt;sup id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-4-back"&gt;&lt;a title="ignore table limits here" href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-4" class="simple-footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for £50653, and again for £1.8 million, which is retirement money and so I stop. The chances of that happening; 1 in 2 million or so. So playing roulette is very roughly equivalent to playing the lottery (chances of getting a million quid: one in some millions). And the lottery is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; easier to do; you don’t have to put on a dinner jacket and walk to the casino, and you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; play for a pound.&lt;sup id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-5-back"&gt;&lt;a title="there are casinos which will let you put a quid on a roulette wheel spin, but good luck finding a table which allows wagering a quid and allows wagering fifty grand" href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-5" class="simple-footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point. I won’t miss the money, it’s very easy to do, and it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; end up changing my life, so why not do it? If I were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; good at maths, maybe I’d plot a graph of some sort of quotient made up of “amount spent” vs “effort required” vs “amount won”. I bet the lottery looks quite a lot better than “working for a living”, on that graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note here that the second part of the meme which is often quoted alongside it is that lotteries are a tax on the poor; that is, people who &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; miss that hundred pounds a year. This is completely correct. I would not notice the half-a-pint a week that the lottery costs me; this is not the case for others, and lotteries being a tax on the poor is entirely correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-1"&gt;not all the time, anyway &lt;a href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-2"&gt;ish &lt;a href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-2-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-3"&gt;People aren’t identical and spherical, either &lt;a href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-3-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-4"&gt;ignore table limits here &lt;a href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-4-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-5"&gt;there are casinos which will let you put a quid on a roulette wheel spin, but good luck finding a table which allows wagering a quid &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; allows wagering fifty grand &lt;a href="#sf-why-i-play-the-lottery-5-back" class="simple-footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 11:54:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag:www.kryogenix.org/days,2015-04-19:2015/04/19/why-i-play-the-lottery/</guid></item></channel></rss>
