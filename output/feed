Then when there’s some sort of breach and you have to change a bunch of passwords&lt;sup id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="this week it was Cloudflare, but there’ll be another next week no doubt" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you could just download a list of domains that need fixing and give it to your password manager, and then your password manager would use the standard password-change &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; on each of those sites to change your password to something else. Job done. That’d be lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about people without a password manager?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, they’re no better off under this plan. But they’re no worse off. And they were likely already using guessable passwords. This problem needs fixing, certainly (have people use password managers, make them easier to use, eliminate passwords entirely, many other suggestions) but fixing it is not the goal of this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does the password manager know where to look?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put a file in &lt;a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/795467/for-what-is-the-well-known-folder"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/.well-known&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which describes the location of the endpoint and the parameters that need to be passed to it or something. That seems an easy problem to solve; your password manager knows the domain, so it just hits &lt;code&gt;https://domain/.well-known/password-change.json&lt;/code&gt; and gets &lt;code&gt;{location: '/std-pwchange', required_parameters: {username: "username", password: "password"}}&lt;/code&gt; or something. The detail here can be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Doesn’t this make compromising people’s accounts easier?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; so, but I might be wrong. At the moment, if I discover your master password I can’t do anything with it without access to your password manager’s database; if I’ve got both your master password &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; access to your passwords database then I can manually go and steal all your accounts everywhere and change all your passwords. Having this doesn’t make it more likely; it just makes it less drudge-work for an attacker to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about sites that require two-factor auth?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this won’t work for them. Then again, if the site requires two-factor auth, having your password potentially compromised in a breach is not as big a deal, right? So the endpoint can return &lt;code&gt;needs-manual-update&lt;/code&gt; and then your password manager pops up a box saying “you have to manually update your password on the following sites: (list of links)”. Which is what it would do for sites that inexplicably have not adopted this idea anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why would anyone adopt this?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same reason anyone adopts anything; it seems a good plan, or everyone else is. This would certainly make life easier for users of password managers&lt;sup id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-2-back"&gt;&lt;a title="I’m told that LastPass actually already supports this auto-password-change idea for lots of sites. Presumably they’re doing a little bit of custom code for each site to know where the password change form is? This would just standardise that and allow a password manager to do it automatically without any work at all, which would be obviously lovely for all concerned" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-a-standard-password-change-api-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and both sites and pw managers can advertise “we make your life easier when this happens” as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I missed a reason why this would be a bad idea? It’d need speccing out in detail, obviously, but the concept to me seems good…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1"&gt;this week it was Cloudflare, but there’ll be another next week no doubt &lt;a class="simple-footnote-back" href="#sf-a-standard-password-change-api-1-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="sf-a-standard-password-change-api-2"&gt;I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LarryABall/status/835222955042947072"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that LastPass actually already supports this auto-password-change idea for lots of sites.

But, three years in, I think I’ve finally actually understood in my own mind the difference between a dividend and a director withdrawal. My accountant, Crunch&lt;sup id="sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="who are really handy, online, and are happy to receive emails in which I ask stupid questions over and over again: if you need an accountant too, this referral link will get us both some money off" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have me record both of them when I take money out of the company, and I didn’t really get why until recently. When I finally got it, I wrote myself a note that I could go back to and read when I get confused again, and I thought I’d publish that here so others can see it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Important note: this is not financial advice.&lt;/strong&gt; If my understanding here differs from your understanding, trust yourself, or your accountant. I’m also likely glossing over many subtleties, etc, etc. If you think this is downright &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, I’d be interested in hearing. If you think it’s over-simplified, you’re doubtless correct.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dividend is a promise to pay you X money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A director withdrawal is you taking that money out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when a pound comes in, you can create a dividend to say: we’ll pay Stuart 80p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take the money out, you record a director withdrawal of 80p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividends are IOUs. Withdrawals are you cashing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOU&lt;/span&gt; in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the “director’s loan account is overdrawn”, that means: you have recorded dividends of N but have recorded director withdrawals of more than N, i.e., you’ve taken out more than the company wants to pay you. This may be because you are owed the amount you took, and recorded director withdrawals for all that but forgot to do a dividend for it, or because you’ve taken more than you’re allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a new dividend (in Crunch) it will (usefully) say what the maximum dividend you can take is; that should be the maximum takeable &lt;em&gt;while still leaving enough money in the account to pay the tax bill&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pay Yourself dashboard (in Crunch) it’ll say “money owed to Stuart”; that’s money that’s been promised with a dividend but not taken out with a withdrawal. (Note: this may be because you forgot to do a withdrawal for money you’ve taken! In theory it would mean money promised with a dividend but not taken, but maybe you took it and just didn’t do a withdrawal to record that you took it. Check.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1"&gt;who are really handy, online, and are happy to receive emails in which I ask stupid questions over and over again: if you need an accountant too, &lt;a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk/referrals/?c2c=sl14342l"&gt;this referral link&lt;/a&gt; will get us both some money off &lt;a class="simple-footnote-back" href="#sf-dividends-and-director-withdrawals-1-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-02-20:2017/02/20/dividends-and-director-withdrawals/</guid></item><item><title>The Quiet Voice</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/02/19/the-quiet-voice/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s harder to find news these days. On the one hand, there&amp;#8217;s news everywhere you turn. Shrieking at you. On the other, we&amp;#8217;re each in a bubble. Articles are rushed out to get clicks; everything&amp;#8217;s got a political slant in one direction or another. This is not new. But it does feel like it&amp;#8217;s getting&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s being recognised, though. Buzzfeed have just launched a thing called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/helping-you-see-outside-your-bubble"&gt;Outside Your Bubble&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, an admirable effort to &amp;#8220;give our audience a glimpse at what&amp;#8217;s happening outside their own social media spaces&amp;#8221;; basically, it&amp;#8217;s a list of links to views for and against at the bottom of certain articles. Boris Smus just wrote up an idea to &lt;a href="http://smus.com/headlines-meet-sparklines-news-in-context/"&gt;add easily-digestible sparkline graphs to news articles which provide context to the numbers quoted&lt;/a&gt;. There have long been services like &lt;a href="http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/"&gt;Channel 4&amp;#8217;s FactCheck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.allsides.com"&gt;AllSides&lt;/a&gt; which try to correct errors in published articles or give a balanced view of the news. Matt Kiser&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt; Just Happened Today&lt;/a&gt; tries to summarise, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/popular-newsletter-uses-open-source-techniques-cover-wtf-happening-trump/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Aside: I am bloody sure that there&amp;#8217;s an xkcd or similar about the idea of the quiet voice, where when someone uses a statistic on telly, the quiet voice says &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s actually only 2% higher than it was under the last president&amp;#8221; or something. But I cannot for the life of me find it.&amp;nbsp;Help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a thing I can install. A browser extension or something. And when I view an article, I get context and viewpoint on it. If the article says &amp;#8220;Trump&amp;#8217;s approval rating is 38%&amp;#8221;, the extension highlights it and says &amp;#8220;other sources say it&amp;#8217;s 45% (link)&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s a list of other presidents&amp;#8217; approval ratings at this point in their terms&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s a link to an argument on why it&amp;#8217;s this number&amp;#8221;. When the article says &amp;#8220;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t have enough trade negotiators to set up trade deals&amp;#8221; there&amp;#8217;s a link to an article claiming that that isn&amp;#8217;t a problem and explaining why. If it says &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; wait times are now longer than they&amp;#8217;ve ever been&amp;#8221; there&amp;#8217;s a graph showing what this response times are, and linking to a study showing that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; funding is dropping faster than response times are. An article saying that X billion is spent on foreign aid gets a note on how much that costs each taxpayer, what proportion of the budget it is, how much people think it is. It provides context, views from outside your bubble, left and right. You get to see what other people think of this and how they contextualise it; you get to see what quoted numbers mean and understand the background. It&amp;#8217;s not political one way or the other; it&amp;#8217;s like a wise aunt commentator, the quiet voice that says &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, here&amp;#8217;s what this means&amp;#8221; so you&amp;#8217;re better informed, of how it&amp;#8217;s relevant to you and what people outside your bubble&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#8217;s why it won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#8217;t work because it&amp;#8217;s a hysterical amount of effort and nobody has a motive to do it. It has to be almost instant; there&amp;#8217;s little point in brilliantly annotating an article three days after it&amp;#8217;s written when everyone&amp;#8217;s already read it. It&amp;#8217;d be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult for it to be non-partisan, and it&amp;#8217;d be even more difficult to make people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it was non-partisan even if it was. There&amp;#8217;s no money in it &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s explicitly not a thing that people go to, but lives on other people&amp;#8217;s sites. And there aren&amp;#8217;t browser extensions on mobile. The Washington Post offer something like this with their &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/16/now-you-can-fact-check-trumps-tweets-in-the-tweets-themselves/"&gt;service to annotate Trump&amp;#8217;s tweets&lt;/a&gt;, but extending it to all news articles everywhere is a huge amount of work. Organisations with a remit to do this sort of thing &amp;#8212; the &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/09/launching-an-independent-opennews-program/"&gt;newly-spun-off Open News&lt;/a&gt; from Mozilla and the Knight Foundation, say &amp;#8212; don&amp;#8217;t have the resources to do anything even approaching this. And it&amp;#8217;s no good if you have to pay for it. People don&amp;#8217;t really want opposing views, thoughts from outside their bubble, graphs and context; that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s caused this thing to need to exist in the first place! So it has to be trivial to add; if you demand money nobody will buy it. So I can&amp;#8217;t see how you pay the army of fact checkers and linkers your need to run this. It can&amp;#8217;t be crowd sourced; if it were then it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a reliable annotation source, it&amp;#8217;d be reddit, which would be disastrous. But it&amp;#8217;d be &lt;em&gt;so useful&lt;/em&gt;. And once it exists they can produce a thing which generates printable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; annotations and I can staple them inside my parents copy of the Daily&amp;nbsp;Mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 12:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-02-19:2017/02/19/the-quiet-voice/</guid></item><item><title>Niobium</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/30/niobium/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[41 is] the smallest integer whose reciprocal has a 5-digit repetend. That is a consequence of the fact that 41 is a factor of 99999. &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand a lot of things, these days. I don&amp;#8217;t understand what a 5-digit repetend is, or why 41 being a factor of 99999 has to do with anything. I don&amp;#8217;t understand &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/01/31/what-i-did-on-my-holidays/"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/01/30/temporarily-older-than-benedict-cumberbatch-for-six-months-again-dammit/"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/01/30/but-these-posts-go-to-eleven/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2013/01/30/thirty-seven-for-gods-sake-how-did-that-happen/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/01/30/a-year-goes-past/"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2011/01/31/brave-new-age/"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2009/01/30/mini-hippo-returns/"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2008/01/30/another-year-passes/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2007/01/30/my-week/"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/30/turning-thirty/"&gt;thirteen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2005/01/30/staring/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2004/01/31/birthdays/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2003/01/30/revolution/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t understand when building web stuff got hard. I don&amp;#8217;t understand why I can&amp;#8217;t find anyone who sells wall lights that look nice without charging a hundred notes for each one, which is a bit steep when you need six. I don&amp;#8217;t understand why I can&amp;#8217;t get thinner and still eat as many sandwiches as I want. I don&amp;#8217;t understand an awful lot of why the world suddenly became a terrible, frightening, mean-spirited, mocking, vitriolic place. And most of what I do understand about that, I&amp;nbsp;hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/"&gt;We all sorta thought&lt;/a&gt; that we were moving forward; there was less hatred of the Other, fewer knives out, not as much fear and spite as there used to be. And it turns out that it wasn&amp;#8217;t gone; it was just suppressed, building up and up underneath the volcano cap until the bad guys realised that there&amp;#8217;s nothing actually &lt;em&gt;stopping&lt;/em&gt; them doing terrible things and there&amp;#8217;s nothing anyone can do about it. So the Tories moved from daring to talk about shutting down the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; to actually doing it and nobody said anything. Or, more accurately, a bunch of people said things and it didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference. Trump starts restricting immigration and targeting Muslims directly and puts a Nazi adviser on the National Security Council and nobody said anything. Or, more accurately, a bunch of people said things and it didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference. I don&amp;#8217;t want to give in to hatred &amp;#8212; it leads to the Dark Side &amp;#8212; and so I don&amp;#8217;t want to hate them for doing this. But I do hate that I have to fight to avoid it. I hate that I feel so helpless. I hate that the only way I know to fight back is to actually fight &amp;#8212; to become &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. I hate that they turn everyone into malign, terrible copies of themselves. I hate that they don&amp;#8217;t understand. I hate that I don&amp;#8217;t understand. I hate that I just hate all the time&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m forty-one. Apparently, according to Wikipedia, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy Fleet Ballistic Missile nuclear submarines from the George Washington, Ethan Allen, Lafayette, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin classes were nicknamed &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41_for_Freedom"&gt;41 for Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. 41 for freedom. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s not a bad motto for me, being 41. Do more for freedom. My freedom, my family&amp;#8217;s freedom, my friends&amp;#8217; freedom, my city&amp;#8217;s freedom, people I&amp;#8217;ve never met and never will&amp;#8217;s freedom. &lt;a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/11/19/none-of-us-are-free/"&gt;None of us are free if one of us is chained&lt;/a&gt;, and if you don’t say it’s wrong then that says it&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is of Niamh, and her present to me for my birthday: a light box like the ones you get outside cinemas and churches and fast food places and we can put messages for one another on it. I&amp;#8217;m hugely pleased with it. The other is of &lt;a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/what-happened-donald-trump-protest-12530307"&gt;today&amp;#8217;s anti-Trump demo in Victoria Square&lt;/a&gt;, at which Reverend David Butterworth, of the Methodist Church, said: &amp;#8220;Whatever we can do to make this a more peaceful city and a more inclusive city, and to stand up and be counted, we must and should do it together. The only way that Donald Trump will win is if the good people of Birmingham, and of other cities that we’re twinned with like Chicago, stay silent.&amp;#8221; People standing up, and a demonstration of what they&amp;#8217;re standing up for. Not a bad way to start making me being 41 for freedom,&amp;nbsp;perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday to me.

&lt;blockquote&gt;this is the thing. We all sorta thought (and by &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; I mean everyone from us here right back to, I dunno, Newton and Boyle) that if we provided inductive or deductive proof of a thing, that everyone else would say &amp;#8220;oh yeah, I&amp;#8217;m convinced now!&amp;#8221; and that&amp;#8217;d be it. But people who don&amp;#8217;t want that to happen have learned that attacking the evidence doesn&amp;#8217;t work &amp;#8212; it took them a few hundred years to learn that, but they did &amp;#8212; but dismissing the whole idea as illegitimate does work. And we don&amp;#8217;t know how to argue against that. I say two and two are four; you disagree; I say &amp;#8220;no look here&amp;#8217;s the proof&amp;#8221;; you say &amp;#8220;your methods of proof are wrong and biased&amp;#8221;; and then I&amp;#8217;m all, er, I don&amp;#8217;t know what to say now, you were meant to be convinced by the proof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

more importantly: a third party, looking at that conversation, goes away thinking &amp;#8220;well, is 2+2 equal to 4? Don&amp;#8217;t know; there seem to be two sides to that argument&amp;#8221;, or worse, &amp;#8220;man, I just don&amp;#8217;t care what 2+2 is because every time I try to find out there&amp;#8217;s just loads of shouting, so I&amp;#8217;ll stop asking&amp;#8221;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

and thus, modern politics. Gaslighting and obfuscation, designed to make people believe that facts are disputable and that engagement is confusing and annoying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(Of course, part of the problem here is that our side have a habit of declaring things to be an actual fact when they&amp;#8217;re really &amp;#8220;what we want to believe&amp;#8221;, and once one&amp;#8217;s cried wolf that way a few times, one&amp;#8217;s credibility is gone and it&amp;#8217;s really hard to get back. It&amp;#8217;s not all the other side&amp;#8217;s fault.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I wouldn&amp;#8217;t re-post such a thing, but of course this conversation happened on Slack, which means that six months from now I won&amp;#8217;t be able to link to this because it&amp;#8217;ll be over 10,000 messages ago and Slack will be holding it to ransom until we pay money, and five years from now I won&amp;#8217;t be able to link to it because Slack will have gone bust or have been sold to someone and shut&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2017-01-26:2017/01/26/we-all-sorta-thought/</guid></item><item><title>None Of Us Are Free</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/11/19/none-of-us-are-free/</link><description>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" style="max-width: 100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFkmRp_G2uo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
Well you better listen my sisters and brothers,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8216;Cause if you do you can hear&lt;br&gt;
There are voices still calling across the years.&lt;br&gt;
And they&amp;#8217;re all crying across the ocean,&lt;br&gt;
And they&amp;#8217;re cryin&amp;#8217; across the land,&lt;br&gt;
And they will till we all come to understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free, if one of us is chained&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are people still in darkness,&lt;br&gt;
And they just can&amp;#8217;t see the light.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t say it&amp;#8217;s wrong then that says it right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We got try to feel for each other, let our brothers know that we care.&lt;br&gt;
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free, if one of us is chained&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I swear your salvation isn&amp;#8217;t too hard too find,&lt;br&gt;
None of us can find it on our own&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got to join together in spirit, heart and mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So that every soul who&amp;#8217;s suffering will know that they&amp;#8217;re not alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free, if one of us is chained&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just look around you,&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;#8217;re gonna see what I say.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8216;Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day&lt;br&gt;
Now it&amp;#8217;s time to start making changes,&lt;br&gt;
And it&amp;#8217;s time for us all to realize,&lt;br&gt;
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us are free&lt;br&gt;
None of us are free&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application of this to the year 2016, how you should deal with everything that&amp;#8217;s happened this year, and how you should stand with your friends and the people around you&amp;#8230; is left as an exercise for the&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 03:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-11-19:2016/11/19/none-of-us-are-free/</guid></item><item><title>OnePlus are great at customer service</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/11/04/oneplus-are-great-at-customer-service/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Around a year ago, I bought a &lt;a href="https://oneplus.net/x"&gt;OnePlus X&lt;/a&gt; phone. I was given a &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StuartLangridge/posts/MWmnte6LsiD?sfc=true"&gt;whole bunch of warnings&lt;/a&gt; by a whole bunch of people that their customer support was terrible and if the phone broke, I stood no chance of getting it&amp;nbsp;repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it broke. Specifically, it stopped charging. I had to wiggle the connector, charge it by holding the lead at different angles, the works. That was really annoying. So I thought: they should fix this. Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday evening, at eleven pm, I used the &amp;#8220;Live Chat&amp;#8221; thing on OnePlus&amp;#8217;s website, and was put in touch with a service engineer named &amp;#8220;Irish&amp;#8221;. I explained the problem. Irish said: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ll fix that; if it turns out you broke it you&amp;#8217;ll be charged, if not we&amp;#8217;ll fix it. A pleasant conversation, in which he talked me through setting up an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMA&lt;/span&gt; request on their support site. Shortly thereafter, I received by email a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHL&lt;/span&gt; dispatch note, which I printed out and glued on the outside of a jiffy bag with my phone in it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHL&lt;/span&gt; rang me up the next morning to arrange pickup; I arranged that for this Monday. A chap arrived and picked up the phone. Today, four days later, I&amp;#8217;ve just got the phone back, delivered back to me by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHL&lt;/span&gt; again, and it&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine how customer service could be any better than this. My thing broke, they picked it up from my flat, repaired it, and delivered it back to my flat at their expense, with no complaints, in four days. This is excellent. Thank you OnePlus, thank you Regenersis the OnePlus service centre, thank you Irish. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m unusual; maybe OnePlus have upped their game in the last year; maybe this is just luck. But this is a sterling example of how interaction with a company &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; go. OnePlus: exemplars of customer service. I am&amp;nbsp;impressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 11:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-11-04:2016/11/04/oneplus-are-great-at-customer-service/</guid></item><item><title>My nominations for the Silicon Canal Tech Awards 2016</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/10/16/my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.silicon-canal-tech-awards.com/categories"&gt;Silicon Canal tech awards&lt;/a&gt; are coming up here in Birmingham, so I thought I’d write down who I’ve nominated and why! Along with a few categories where I had difficulty deciding, in which an honourable mention or two may be awarded, although such things do not get submitted to the actual award ceremony :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Best Tech Start-Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://birmingham.impacthub.net/"&gt;ImpactHub Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ImpactHub say, “We want to empower a collective movement to bring about change in our city, embracing a diverse range of people and organisations with a whole host of experiences and skills.” ImpactHub is a place enabling the tech scene in Birmingham, which is the most important part of it all; that’s what makes Birmingham great and more than just some half-baked clone of London or San Francisco. Bringing tech companies together with the rest of the city also hugely increases the number of connections made and opportunities created right here in Birmingham itself, and helps tech entrepreneurs meet other communities and unify everyone’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most Influential Female in Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://jessica.tech/"&gt;Jessica Rose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jess tirelessly advocates technology and Birmingham, both inside and outside the city. She’s great at connecting dots, showing people who they can work with to get things done, and advising on how best to grow a community or a company into areas you might not have otherwise pursued. And she’s helpful and engaging and good to work with, and knows basically everyone. That’s influence, and she’s using it to better the Brum tech scene as a whole, and that deserves reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/immykaur"&gt;Immy Kaur&lt;/a&gt; for setting up ImpactHub :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Small Tech Company of the Year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://technicalteamsolutions.co.uk/"&gt;Technical Team Solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; are heavily invested in the tech life of Birmingham itself. They sponsor events, they’ve partnered with Silicon Canal as exclusive recruitment agents, and most importantly they’re behind Fusion, a regular and vibrant quarterly tech conference drawn from the city and supporting both local tech and local street food vendors. This isn’t like some other conferences which basically are in Birmingham by coincidence; Fusion is intimately involved with the Brum tech scene, as are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; themselves, and that should be massively encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.jump24.co.uk/"&gt;Jump 24&lt;/a&gt;, web design and development studio getting good stuff done and run by a very smart and very short Welshman&lt;sup id="sf-my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="sorry, Dan; Fusion just tips it for TTS, but maybe you should run a conference as well to lobby for the vote :)" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Large Tech Company of the Year (revenue over £10 million)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://talis.com/"&gt;Talis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talis are strong supporters of the Birmingham tech scene, a successful large scaleup here in the city, and willing to work openly with others in pursuit of those goals. They regularly sponsor tech events with money or by providing space to host meetups, hold hack days and write about them afterwards, donate time and money to helping others in the city including events for entrepreneurs as well as developers, and run their own events (such as Codelicious) to add more to the growing vibrancy of Brum. It’s great to see a company of this size be cognisant of the city and their life within it, and this certainly deserves to be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most Influential Male in Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roymeredith"&gt;Roy Meredith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jolly good way to make connections in the city is through Roy, who is connected to all sorts of people via being responsible for the tech sectors in Marketing Birmingham. I’m not sure the government marketing agency are always perfect, but I am sure that Roy is a person to know. He’s an engaging public speaker, he’s got a background in industry (with a list of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAA&lt;/span&gt; games he’s worked on that’d blow your mind), and he’s approachable and smart and everyone listens to him. If that’s not influence, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Outstanding Technology Individual of the Year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mary Matthews from &lt;a href="http://memricaprompt.com/"&gt;Memrica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary describes herself as “passionate about using technology to make a difference to people’s lives” and, unlike quite a few people who might say that, I think she actually means it. It was marvellous to see Memrica get recognised as part of the UberPITCH consultancy earlier this year, and her trip out to meet Travis Kalanick not only will have helped her continue her long history of doing good tech things but also helped elevate Birmingham’s profile as a place for internationally recognised startups. That’s pretty outstanding, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jesslynrose"&gt;Jess Rose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Others&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Angel or Seed Investor of the Year:&lt;/strong&gt; no nomination here because I have no idea! I know a couple, but haven’t worked with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduate Developer of the Year:&lt;/strong&gt; no nomination here because I don’t know enough graduates. I’d have nominated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackweirdy"&gt;@jackweirdy&lt;/a&gt; if he hadn’t left us :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer of the Year:&lt;/strong&gt; no nomination here because, well, too contentious. I don’t know who I’d pick as the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;, and I do know that everyone I don’t pick will never buy me a pint again, so I’m not sure who to say here. Maybe I should have just picked myself :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now, your turn&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you agree, maybe you don’t. That’s what I think. You will notice that I primarily care about the tech life of the city; if you do a bunch of good stuff here in Birmingham and you’re proud of that, I like what you do. If you do interesting things but never talk about them here in the city, I’m less interested in your things. Perhaps you have different criteria: you should now go and say what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think. &lt;a href="http://www.silicon-canal-tech-awards.com/categories"&gt;Go and add your nominations&lt;/a&gt;, Birmingham people; let’s get everyone’s voices heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="simple-footnotes"&gt;&lt;li id="sf-my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016-1"&gt;sorry, Dan; Fusion just tips it for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt;, but maybe you should run a conference as well to lobby for the vote :) &lt;a class="simple-footnote-back" href="#sf-my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016-1-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2016 19:02:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-10-16:2016/10/16/my-nominations-for-the-silicon-canal-tech-awards-2016/</guid></item><item><title>Feeling old, depending on how old you are</title><link>//www.kryogenix.org/days/2016/08/11/feeling-old/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered &lt;a href="http://mewo2.com/"&gt;Martin O’Leary&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/feelingoldbot"&gt;Feeling Old twitter bot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id="sf-feeling-old-1-back"&gt;&lt;a title="because I was reading his excellent work on how to create accurate looking fantasy maps" class="simple-footnote" href="#sf-feeling-old-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which has a big list of “things that have happened” and then constructs comparisons such as “&lt;span class="caps"&gt;Y2K&lt;/span&gt; was as close to the release of Return of the Jedi as to now”, to make you do that weird “wow, I am old!” double-take. As Martin says, it occasionally throws out a gem. But, looking through the list, I think that they’re probably all gems, but whether they hit home for you depends on how old you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the form of the sentence is: &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; is closer to &lt;code&gt;old thing&lt;/code&gt; than to today. Ideally, you want &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; to be something that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is recent, and &lt;code&gt;old thing&lt;/code&gt; to be something that you think is ancient, and therefore you’ll be surprised that &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; really isn’t actually recent and that’s because you’re a decrepit old codger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory is this: &lt;code&gt;old thing&lt;/code&gt; ought to be before you were born. By definition, anything that happens before you were born feels like a long time ago to you. And the gap between &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;old thing&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the gap between &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;now&lt;/code&gt; (because that’s what constructs the sentences). So &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; has to happen in the first half of your life. Stuff that happens while you’re a &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; child also feels like a long time ago — you were a kid when it happened! — so we want something that happened once you started to feel like &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; in your head. Say, around 12 or so years of age. Thus, we take a big list of pop culture things, find an event which happened between the ages of 12 and half your current age, find a corresponding old event, display them to you, and have you be surprised and displeased. It’s a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="border: 4px solid rgba(50,50,50,0.3); padding: 1em"&gt;

(As Sam Hewitt &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StuartLangridge/posts/A1XypgwkMyU"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, I have &amp;#8220;become a themer&amp;#8221;.) I didn&amp;#8217;t know this was doable, and I went from not knowing this to having it done in the space of about half an hour. It is rare that something just works this nicely; I&amp;#8217;ve been living my life a long time and I know how it works. So far, the other shoe hasn&amp;#8217;t dropped, which is&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;At first, there was&amp;nbsp;Android&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my Android home screen now looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/random/android-minimal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty pleased with that. (The lock screen is even more minimal and pretty, but we&amp;#8217;re not talking about lock screens today: see &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+StuartLangridge/posts/A1XypgwkMyU"&gt;the G+ post&lt;/a&gt; for what that looks&amp;nbsp;like.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; concern here &amp;#8212; in general, I don&amp;#8217;t like using icons without text to indicate a thing, because it means you&amp;#8217;re spending cognitive time remembering &lt;em&gt;what an icon stands for&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;what it&amp;#8217;s similar to&lt;/em&gt;. That is: icons are quite good for, say, files where you want to see that all of these are &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files, but they&amp;#8217;re not good for actions where you have to remember what a &amp;#8220;heart&amp;#8221; or some obscure little symbol means. I&amp;#8217;ve lost count of the number of times when I&amp;#8217;ve used a new app which only has icons and not text labels on its buttons and I have &lt;em&gt;no idea&lt;/em&gt; what half the icons &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;; a few things are enshrined by everyone using them (a Share icon, a Save icon, an Open icon, etc) but most of the time using an icon alone to indicate an action or an app is a bad idea. However, this is an exception to that rule. I am very familiar with my home screen; the set of apps on it do not change very much at all. So there&amp;#8217;s minimal cognitive load in remembering that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; icon is for Twitter and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; one is for Moon Reader. I do a reasonable proportion of that by spatial arrangement; the icons don&amp;#8217;t move around, and I am familiar and trained in where they are. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to ship a phone which looks like this to a new user, but it&amp;#8217;s a perfectly good experience for me, with my own personal home screen that I know&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this beautiful miracle achieved? Well. The default Android home screen doesn&amp;#8217;t let you change the icons used for apps. So when I discovered the (free!) &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.natewren.linesfree&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Lines icon set&lt;/a&gt; in the Play store my immediate thought was, cor, how does that work? And the answer is: use a different home screen app (in Android parlance, they&amp;#8217;re called &lt;em&gt;launchers&lt;/em&gt;). So I installed &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Nova Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. (This also had the rather nice benefit of allowing me to remove the hated Google search bar; I never, ever, ever used that because it shows results in some Google app rather than the web, meaning that you can&amp;#8217;t long-press on images to save them or on links to open in a new tab. Pack it in, Google. Open in the browser. It&amp;#8217;s good at that.) A little bit of setup with Nova Launcher and Lines and, lo, I had the nice minimal icons and pretty dark wallpaper (which came with Lines). Nova Launcher doesn&amp;#8217;t let you resize the icons, and by default they&amp;#8217;re a bit small, but you can buy the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Nova Launcher Prime&lt;/a&gt; add-on to enable that, and it was fifty pence so that&amp;#8217;s a no-brainer. The Lines icon set is both worryingly comprehensive (they claim to have over two thousand icons!) and equally worryingly incomplete (with a million apps in the Play store they&amp;#8217;re never going to carry them all, but not having Telegram? Seriously?) and so I added two more similar-looking icon sets (&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryanmkelly.me.min&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jimonen.glyphsyiconpack&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Glyphsy&lt;/a&gt;) to give me a wider choice. A bunch of tweaking of icon sizes, icon choices, margin sizes, and so on later and I have the screen above, and every time I look at it I like it a little more. Ultra-happy with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And then there was&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, hang on, it ought to be possible to do the same thing with Ubuntu phone, right? One can write a custom scope which looks like that and shows all one&amp;#8217;s apps, and add it to the Dash as the only scope, and then you&amp;#8217;ve got a cool-looking app-launcher home screen. Sweet. That&amp;#8217;s what I want. And it&amp;#8217;ll give me an excuse to play with all the new scopes stuff and learn something about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast,&amp;nbsp;grasshopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my basic idea. The existing apps scope is annoyingly slow; I&amp;#8217;m sure it does a whole bunch of stuff and that&amp;#8217;s why, but it&amp;#8217;s slow to load, slow to scroll, and slow to react to things changing. This is obviously being worked on by the Canonical team and I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll get better, but currently it&amp;#8217;s pretty frustrating. So I thought: what I&amp;#8217;ll do is this. I&amp;#8217;ll add a &lt;a href="http://click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hooks.html"&gt;click hook&lt;/a&gt; so when apps get installed and removed I can update a sqlite database, and then my scope will just hit that database rather than inspecting the filesystem and loading loads of files. That database can also hold the locations of icons in my custom &amp;#8220;wireframe&amp;#8221; icon theme, and it&amp;#8217;ll use those icons for the apps. So it&amp;#8217;ll be fast and have custom icons, and tapping an icon will launch that app via &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/phone/platform/guides/url-dispatcher-guide/"&gt;an &lt;code&gt;application:///&lt;/code&gt; url&lt;/a&gt;. Job&amp;#8217;s a good&amp;#8217;un, etc. Off down the&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not as easy as I had&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that made the task difficult and which are basically my fault and for which no blame attaches to the Ubuntu team. Firstly, I&amp;#8217;m still running Ubuntu 14.04. This is because it&amp;#8217;s an long-term-support release, and LTSes don&amp;#8217;t offer to upgrade to the next &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; release (16.04, which came out in April) until the first point release (16.04.1, which isn&amp;#8217;t out at time of writing). This is so the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt; gets a bit of testing before it hits all the people who desire stability, and is a good idea, and I am entirely happy with it. Secondly, I wanted to write the scope in JavaScript; one can write Unity 8 scopes in C++ (which I can&amp;#8217;t do), Go (which I can&amp;#8217;t do), and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; via node (which I am completely comfortable with). But the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scopes stuff is new, and so doesn&amp;#8217;t exist in 14.04. This meant that I had to do a great deal of faffing around in lxc containers to get a working version of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scope. However, that faffery did actually work out in the end, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see the need for it as due to anything more than my own desire to not upgrade away from the latest stable release &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTS&lt;/span&gt;. So, no blame there, as mentioned. After a bit of poking, I managed to get a JavaScript scope, and some discussions with Brian Douglass and one tiny bash deploy script later (which basically does &lt;code&gt;click build .&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;adb push&lt;/code&gt;es the &lt;code&gt;.click&lt;/code&gt; file to my Bq E4.5 and &lt;code&gt;pkcon install-local&lt;/code&gt;s it), I had a scope that I&amp;#8217;d written running on the phone. Hooray! Now to make that scope actually do and look as I want it&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we run into problems. The JavaScript scopes stuff is, admittedly, new, but it had two major issues that caused me a great deal of grief. The first is that making async &lt;code&gt;fs.readdir&lt;/code&gt; calls early in a scope &lt;code&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; handler were making my scope crash, and sometimes crashing all of Unity. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598967"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598967&lt;/a&gt;) Oops. That took some time debugging before I eventually went for the synchronous &lt;code&gt;fs.readdirSync&lt;/code&gt;, cursing all the while. Worse, though, is the &lt;code&gt;activate&lt;/code&gt; problem. You see, a scope, by default, when a thing is tapped shows you the &lt;em&gt;preview page&lt;/em&gt; for that thing. However, you can change things so that a tap on a thing does something directly; in this case, of course, I wanted a tap on one of my app icons to launch that app via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; dispatcher. To do that, you call &lt;code&gt;set_intercept_activation()&lt;/code&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/scopes/js/sdk-15.04.4/ScopeJS.CategorisedResult/"&gt;scope icon&lt;/a&gt; when you create it, and then Unity will call your scope&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;runtime_config.activate()&lt;/code&gt; method with the details when that icon is tapped; you can then handle it in whatever way you want, or return an &lt;code&gt;ActivationNotHandled&lt;/code&gt; type of &lt;code&gt;ActivationResponse&lt;/code&gt; to let Unity handle it for you, which in this case means &amp;#8220;open the app with the url you provided&amp;#8221;. (You can see a good example of how this works in Go in &lt;a href="https://github.com/bhdouglass/falcon/blob/master/src/falcon.go#L98"&gt;Brian Douglass&amp;#8217;s Falcon alternative app scope&lt;/a&gt;.) However! If you do that in JavaScript, your scope ignores the tap and throws an error about how you &lt;code&gt;returned nullptr from activate()&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598969"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598969&lt;/a&gt;.) As the bug says, &amp;#8220;this, in practice, means it&amp;#8217;s impossible to write a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scope which allows tapping on a result item to do anything other than show the preview (for example, launching an&amp;nbsp;app).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The observant will notice that the &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/scopes/js/sdk-15.04.5/ScopeJS/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scopes documentation&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t actually &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;ActivationResponse&lt;/code&gt; or even that &lt;code&gt;activate()&lt;/code&gt; handlers are possible in &lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/scopes/js/sdk-15.04.5/ScopeJS.Scope/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;scope.initialize()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will hopefully get better as the docs get&amp;nbsp;written.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;#8217;s just a bug, and I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;ll get fixed (I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll all be fixed). It is frustrating (has nobody writing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; scopes stuff ever &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;set_intercept_activation()&lt;/code&gt;? Isn&amp;#8217;t there lots of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt; built into the Ubuntu process now?) But it&amp;#8217;s a temporary thing, I&amp;#8217;m sure, and in the same class of &amp;#8220;frustrating and show-stopping but will be fixed eventually&amp;#8221; things as how &lt;code&gt;unity-js-scopes-tool&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t build &lt;code&gt;node-pre-gyp&lt;/code&gt; packages (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-js-scopes/+bug/1598971"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598971&lt;/a&gt;) or that &lt;code&gt;unity-js-scopes-tool&lt;/code&gt; seems to actually &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; binary itself but that&amp;#8217;s carefully kept secret for some reason, or that you have to remove and reinstall an app if you change the apparmor stuff otherwise the changes aren&amp;#8217;t picked up (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/click/+bug/1549369"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1549369&lt;/a&gt;) which cost me an hour of banging my head against the desk (thanks mzanetti for helping). They&amp;#8217;ll get fixed. Move&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things which actually stopped me building the scope I wanted weren&amp;#8217;t these sorts of incidental bugs; they&amp;#8217;re design decisions saying that what I want should not be possible. I&amp;#8217;m hoping that the detail I&amp;#8217;m going into here helps to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I want these things, and perhaps makes its way back to the team deciding on this stuff and helps to inform their&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example. You see how my Android screen above has four columns of app icons? Like the Ubuntu apps scope has? Well&amp;#8230; my replacement scope can&amp;#8217;t. Scopes are only allowed three columns of icons. The apps scope has been magically &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity8/+bug/1490388"&gt;hardcoded into Unity&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed four columns; nobody else can do that. That&amp;#8217;s pretty&amp;nbsp;annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, customisation of the look of a scope is superficially good but actually rather limited. A scope &lt;em&gt;header&lt;/em&gt; can have a custom background image, but a scope itself can&amp;#8217;t; you can pick a colour, but you can&amp;#8217;t set an image as the background for your scope. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-scopes-api/+bug/1598973"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598973&lt;/a&gt;) Scopes put the &amp;#8220;Ubuntu shape&amp;#8221; around all your scope icons, but you can turn that off by settings &lt;code&gt;ShapeImages=false&lt;/code&gt; in your scope ini file. Except&amp;#8230; that doesn&amp;#8217;t work; it&amp;#8217;s ignored, and you always get the Ubuntu shape border on every image, whether you want it or not. (&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-scopes-api/+bug/1598933"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;#1598933&lt;/a&gt;) I understand the idea behind shaping imagery, but it looks heart-stoppingly ugly when done to icons with transparent backgrounds, such as all the &amp;#8220;wireframe&amp;#8221; icons I planned to use in this project. You can have settings for your scope, but they can&amp;#8217;t change the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt;, because that stuff&amp;#8217;s not programmatic; it&amp;#8217;s in the &lt;code&gt;scope.ini&lt;/code&gt; file and can&amp;#8217;t be changed by code. So I can&amp;#8217;t allow people to have a dark scope with white icons (as above) or choose a light scope with black icons. Also, making a replacement apps scope is essentially fruitless because the default apps scope cannot be removed. You can&amp;#8217;t turn it off; it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be present in your Dash. This to me seems strange; I&amp;#8217;m fine with you not being able to &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; it, but it will always be present in the bottom-edge menu. Fine, maybe making replacement apps scopes is an edge case, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to get the feeling that my phone is mine when I&amp;#8217;m obliged to keep the default apps scope around even if I&amp;#8217;ve got a&amp;nbsp;replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the idea of making the scope fast by populating a database? You can&amp;#8217;t have that, either. Yes, there are click hooks. But you can&amp;#8217;t install one. They must be stored in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/click/hooks&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;#8217;s part of the system image, which is read-only. What this means is that there&amp;#8217;s no way that a third-party app will ever be able to be informed of app installs and removals, sadly. I can put an app which requires extra permissions into the &lt;a href="https://open.uappexplorer.com/"&gt;Open Store&lt;/a&gt;, but even such an app can&amp;#8217;t install a click hook; I&amp;#8217;d have to make it a deb, and even then a deb won&amp;#8217;t install either unless you mark your image as read-write, which requires plugging it into a computer. Talking someone through that process is close to impossible unless they&amp;#8217;re the hardest of the hardcore Ubuntu touch hackers. Perhaps click might look in some other folder as well, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; accessible to apps, and have a new apparmor permission protect that folder? Then it would be possible for an application to request that permission and keep a database of installed and removed apps up to date, which would allow us to compete on making a better app launching&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all this means that the best I can do on Ubuntu is this. Ubuntu shapes around the transparent icons, no background imagery, three columns. And that&amp;#8217;s just not pretty, I&amp;#8217;m sad to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.kryogenix.org/random/appease.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I freely admit that some of this is down to the icons, which I drew quickly, and some more is down to the E4.5 having much worse screen resolution than my OnePlus X. But those aren&amp;#8217;t the only&amp;nbsp;things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I still have my beautiful Android home screen. But I&amp;#8217;ve reluctantly decided that I just can&amp;#8217;t do that on Ubuntu. Maybe it&amp;#8217;ll be possible later; maybe these bugs will be fixed and the design decisions revisited. I hope the above explains why I think that&amp;#8217;s important and what app developers could maybe do if those restrictions are slightly relaxed. Fingers&amp;nbsp;crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">sil</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2016 00:27:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>tag://www.kryogenix.org/days,2016-07-05:2016/07/05/making-a-better-ubuntu-app-scope-not-very-successfully/</guid></item></channel></rss>
