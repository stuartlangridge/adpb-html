		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I got to spend a few days with <a href="https://twitter.com/rose0window">Andy</a> and his wife Gaby and their exciting new dog, Iwa. I don&#8217;t get to see them as often as I should, but since they&#8217;ve now moved rather closer to Castle Langridge we&#8217;re going to correct that. And since they&#8217;re in the Cotswolds I got to peer at a whole bunch of things. Mostly things built of yellow stone, admittedly. It is a source of never-ending pleasure that despite twenty-three years of conversation we still never run out of things to talk about. There is almost nothing more delightful than spending an afternoon over a pint arguing about what technological innovation you&#8217;d take back to Elizabethan England. (This is a harder question than you&#8217;d think. Sure, you can take your iPhone back and a solar charger, and it&#8217;d be an incredibly powerful computer, but what would they use it for? They can do all the maths that they need; it&#8217;s just slower. Maybe you&#8217;d build a dynamo and gift them electricity, but where would you get the magnets from? Imagine this interspersed with excellent beer from the <a href="http://www.thevolunteerinn.net/">Volunteer</a> and you have a flavour of&nbsp;it.)</p>
<p>There were also some <a href="http://www.rollrightstones.co.uk/">Rollright Stones</a>, as guided by Julian Cope&#8217;s finest-guidebook-ever <a href="http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/">The Modern Antiquarian</a>. But that&#8217;s not the&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>The thing is <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/snowshill-manor-and-garden">Snowshill Manor</a>. There was a bloke and his name was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Paget_Wade">Charles Paget Wade</a>. Did some painting (at which he was not half bad), did some architecting (also not bad), wrote some poetry. And also inherited a dumper truck full of money by virtue of his family&#8217;s sugar plantations in the West Indies. This money he used to assemble an exceedingly diverse collection of Stuff, which you can now go and see by looking around Snowshill. What&#8217;s fascinating about this is that he didn&#8217;t just amass the Stuff into a big pile and then donate the house to the National Trust as a museum to hold it. Every room in the house was individually curated by him; this room for these objects, that room for those, what he called &#8220;an attractive set of rooms pictorially&#8221;. There&#8217;s some rhyme and some reason &#8212; one of the upstairs rooms is full of clanking, rigid, iron bicycles, and another full of suits of samurai armour &#8212; but mostly they&#8217;re things he just felt fitted together somehow. He&#8217;s like Auri from the Kingkiller Chronicles; this room cries out for this thing to be in it. (If you&#8217;ve read the first two Kingkiller books but haven&#8217;t read <em>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</em>, go and read it and know more of Auri than you currently do.) There&#8217;s a room with a few swords, and a clock that doesn&#8217;t work, and a folding table, and a box with an enormously ornate lock and a set of lawn bowls, and a cabinet containing a set of spectacles and a picture of his grandmother and a ball carved from ivory inside which is a second ball carved from the same piece of ivory inside which is yet another ball. The rhyme and the reason were all in his head, I think. I like to imagine that sometimes he&#8217;d wake up in his strange bedroom with its huge carved crucifix at four in the morning and scurry into the house to carefully carry a blue Japanese vase from the Meridian Room into Zenity and then sit back, quietly satisfied that the cosmic balance was somehow improved. Or to study a lacquered cabinet for an hour and a half and then tentatively shift it an inch to the left, so it sits there just so. So it&#8217;s <em>right</em>. I don&#8217;t know if the order, the placing, the detail of the collection actually speaks as loudly to anyone as it spoke to him, and it doesn&#8217;t matter. You could spend the rest of your life hearing the stories about everything there and never get off the ground&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>Take that room of samurai armour, for example. One of the remarkable things about the collection (there are so many remarkable things about the collection) is that rather a lot of it is Oriental &#8212; Japanese or Chinese, mainly &#8212; but Wade never went to China or Japan. A good proportion of the objects came from other stately homes, selling off items after the First World War &#8212; whether because none of the family were left, or for financial reasons, or maybe just that the occupants came home and didn&#8217;t want it all any more. The armour is a case in point; Wade needed some plumbing done on the house and went off to chat to a plumber&#8217;s merchant about it, where he found a box of scrap metal. Since the bloke was the Lord High Emperor of looking for objects that caught his fancy, he had a look through this discarded pile and found in it&#8230; about fifteen suits of samurai armour. (A large box, to be sure.) So he asked the merchant what the score was, and was told: oh, those, yeah, take them if you want&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>This sort of thing doesn&#8217;t happen to me all that&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>Outside that room, just hanging on the wall, is the door from a carriage; one of the ones with the large wheels, all pulled by horses. Like the cabs that Sherlock Holmes rode in, or that the Queen takes to coronations. It was monogrammed <span class="caps">ECC</span>, and had one of those coats of arms where you just know that the family have been around for a while because two different shields have been quartered in it and then it&#8217;s been quartered again. After some entirely baseless speculation we discovered that it was owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Temple,_Viscountess_Palmerston">Countess Cowper</a>. She married Lord Palmerston; her brother was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lamb,_2nd_Viscount_Melbourne">William Lamb</a>, Lord Melbourne, who was another Prime Minister and had the Australian city named after him; his wife was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Caroline_Lamb">Lady Caroline Lamb</a>, who infamously described Byron as &#8220;mad, bad, and dangerous to know&#8221;. History is all intertwined around&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>None of the clocks in the house work. Apparently at one point Wade had a guest over who glanced at a clock and assumed she had plenty of time to catch her train. Of course, she missed it, and on hearing from him that of course the clocks don&#8217;t tell the right time, she was not best pleased. Not sure who it was. Virginia Woolf, or someone like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>There is too much stuff. He can&#8217;t possibly have kept it all in his head. You can&#8217;t possibly keep it all in, walking around. Visitors ought to be banned from going into more than three or four rooms; by the time you&#8217;ve got halfway through it&#8217;s just impossible to give each place the attention it deserves. There are hardly any paintings; Wade liked actual things, not drawings or representations. It&#8217;s not an art gallery. It&#8217;s a craftsmanship gallery; Wade sought out things that were made, that showed beauty or artistry or ingenuity in their construction. Objects, not drawings; stuff that demonstrates human creation at work. The house is like walking around inside his head, I think. (&#8220;Sometimes I think the asylum is a head. We&#8217;re inside a huge head that dreams us all into being. Perhaps it&#8217;s your head,&nbsp;Batman.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Next time you&#8217;re near Evesham, go&nbsp;visit.</p>
