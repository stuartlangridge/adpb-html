			<p>So, this evening, there were beers with <a href="https://twitter.com/dnews">Dan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/takesdcake">Ebz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/__cmm">Charles</a> and after a brief flirtation with the Alchemist (where we didn&#8217;t go, since the bar was three deep and they might be good at cocktails but they&#8217;re really, really <em>slow</em> at cocktails and so I didn&#8217;t fancy waiting fifteen minutes just to get to the bar) and the Bureau (who are also good at cocktails, and sell an interesting Czech lager with a picture of the brewery on the glass (and while I&#8217;m on the subject, why does every bar feel it necessary to sell me Beer X in a Beer X-branded glass these days? I really don&#8217;t care, bar staff of the world. Don&#8217;t feel like you have to)), we descended upon the <a href="http://www.indianbrewery.com/">Indian Brewery</a> in their new place under the arches. Honestly, up to now, I&#8217;d tried their Birmingham Lager in cans (perfectly nice), and that was it; I&#8217;d never been to their bar. And it&#8217;s fabulous. I was vaguely peckish before getting there but I probably wouldn&#8217;t have bothered with anything; I flirted with the menu in Bureau but was basically ungrabbed by whatever it is that grabs me about menus. And then we piled out of the cab (which we&#8217;d got in to save Ebz and her tottery heels; obviously Sport Dan would have walked the distance to get there but I was quietly glad of not having to) into Indian and the delectable smell of the place completely turned me around. Twenty feet from the place I was mildly thinking about food; six feet from the door I was ready to eat a horse, and one of my companions, and possibly a road sign. This is a place that knows how to capitalise on the weaknesses of their punters. On the way in the door we we interrupted by a chap who, tactfully, hasn&#8217;t skipped many lunches, who asked us: are you eating? Yes, we all said, salivating. And this helpful chap cleared away a small end of a table &#8212; the Indian Brewery interior is organised as a batch of wooden benches, like the ones you get in a pub garden. So if you&#8217;re not eating, he&#8217;ll find you a space to sit in between others; if you are, he&#8217;ll find you a slightly larger block, possibyl by elbowing those already there. And the friendliness doesn&#8217;t end there. Everything, from the Bollywood posters on the wall to the attitude of the staff and the casual, no-frills nature of the layout exudes friendliness; it feels welcoming, like someone took the concept of welcomingness and distilled it out of the air into an atmosphere that pervades the whole place and stepping into it feels like a hot bath. And the Fat Naan is utterly delightful. &#8220;Are you sure you want a whole fat naan to yourself?&#8221; asked Dan. Yes. Yes, I was sure. And I was right. It was bloody delectable. Honestly, I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. Good beers (and a good <em>selection</em> of beers, moreover, which I wasn&#8217;t expecting), great Indian food, friendly staff. If you want more from a place, I can&#8217;t see what it is <em>that</em> you&nbsp;want.</p>
