		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>A long time ago, when I was young and you were even younger, gentle reader, we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes">Acorn Archimedes</a> computers at school. Back when there was more than one kind of computer. The Arc was great. There will be those who liked the Amiga, or the Atari <span class="caps">ST</span>, but those were basically small toy computers for children. Yes. Long live the&nbsp;Archimedes.</p>
<p>Anyway, for no reason I can discern, this evening I remembered a thing on the Arc; a &#8220;sound demo&#8221;. It was just a looping sample, presented as an app; you ran the app and it played the sample, over and over. It was a short little composition &#8212; a few seconds, only &#8212; made up of different snippets taken from Bond films over a bit of music. This may not seem exciting to you, with your instantly streamable 4K video and stuff, but it was pretty goshdarn exciting back then. Get off my&nbsp;lawn.</p>
<p>I thought to myself: I wonder if that&#8217;s still around? A bit of googling led me to <a href="http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/systems/acorn/riscos/CONTENTS">an old archive of <span class="caps">RISC</span> <span class="caps">OS</span> software</a> and there it was: &#8220;<code>[007.spk](http://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/systems/acorn/riscos/demos/007.spk): Sound-demo</code><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>. A download later, and then&#8230; what format is it in? <code>file 007.spk</code> says it&#8217;s &#8220;data&#8221;, which is not helpful, because that&#8217;s <code>libmagic</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>s codename for &#8220;no idea what this is, dude&#8221;. What&#8217;s an spk file? More googling &#8212; no, it&#8217;s not an installation package for Synology NASes, no it&#8217;s not a design for an electronics board, and then someone mentioned SparkPlug. In those days there were many, many, many compression formats. It&#8217;s not like now where there are basically <span class="caps">ZIP</span> files and occasionally <span class="caps">RAR</span> and tar.gz and that&#8217;s it. There was <span class="caps">ZOO</span>, <span class="caps">LHA</span>, <span class="caps">ARC</span>, loads of them. Zip files were the thing that <span class="caps">PKZIP</span> produced, and that was shareware. Loads of them. And on the Archimedes, everyone used SparkPlug. Actually, it was <a href="https://www.davidpilling.com/spark.html">SparkFS</a>, by David Pilling; you needed that (which cost money) to make Spark archives. But SparkPlug was free, and just did decompression. Unsurprisingly, that never got ported to other platforms, and I was mildly disappointed to discover that my desktop didn&#8217;t know how to open it without being told. But some more googling around led to <a href="https://github.com/mjwoodcock/nspark">nspark</a>, a &#8220;dearchiver for <span class="caps">RISC</span> <span class="caps">OS</span> archives&#8221;. You have to compile it, but by this time I had the bit between my teeth &#8212; digital preservation is <em>everybody&#8217;s</em> responsibility! &#8212; and the <code>COMPILING</code> file says that that&#8217;s literally one command, <code>make -f makefile.gcc</code>. Run that and you get an <code>nspark</code> binary, and <code>nspark 007.spk</code> unpacks it! I have a folder named <code>!James</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>ls !James
MemAlloc  !Run  !RUNIMAGE  !RunImage2  !Sprites
</pre></div>


<p>Arc software came in a folder; if that folder was called <code>!something</code>, then it got treated like a single file you could drag around and run. This is the idea that the Mac used, later, for its application bundles (and I wish Linux software worked that way, but that ship&#8217;s sailed). Anyway, you could click the app and it would actually execute a file named <code>!Run</code>, inside the bundle. That file was a sort of tiny script which would set things up and then normally execute <code>!RunImage</code>, which was your actual compiled program, and indeed that&#8217;s what this one does too. So, <code>!RunImage</code> was the binary&#8230; and <code>!RunImage2</code> was 200K, by far the largest file in the bundle, so the sound sample had to be in there. But&#8230; what format is it? <code>file</code> again claimed that it was &#8220;data&#8221;, but I thought: it&#8217;s a sound sample, right? I bet it&#8217;s just raw sound data. Can it be&nbsp;played?</p>
<p><code>aplay !James/!RunImage2</code> gave a burst of meaningless noise. Hrm. Are there formats for these things? Read the help&#8230; ah, yes, there are. And <code>aplay -f S16_LE</code> plays it understandably, hooray! But that just plays&#8230; how do I make this into an actual modern&nbsp;file?</p>
<p>Aha, again. <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> allows importing raw audio. So, we import it, as a 16-bit set of samples, at sample rate 7600 (8000 sounded a tiny bit fast) and&#8230; success! Save as an mp3, and that works&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>Not a hugely critical piece of software archaeology, but nice nonetheless. And I know of no better way of backing stuff like this up than to write a blog post about it so that a decade from now when I think of it again, it&#8217;s still here. The <code>!Run</code> file credits a Toby Cole on 25/2/90 and says: <code>well here it is!!</code>. Nice one Toby. Here it is&nbsp;again.</p>
