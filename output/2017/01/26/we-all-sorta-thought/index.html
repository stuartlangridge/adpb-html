			<p>A thing I wrote today, about Trump and Brexit and "post-truth" and "alternative facts" and helplessness, because I've had this conversation separately three times today.</p>
<blockquote>this is the thing. We all sorta thought (and by "we" I mean everyone from us here right back to, I dunno, Newton and Boyle) that if we provided inductive or deductive proof of a thing, that everyone else would say "oh yeah, I'm convinced now!" and that'd be it. But people who don't want that to happen have learned that attacking the evidence doesn't work -- it took them a few hundred years to learn that, but they did -- but dismissing the whole idea as illegitimate does work. And we don't know how to argue against that. I say two and two are four; you disagree; I say "no look here's the proof"; you say "your methods of proof are wrong and biased"; and then I'm all, er, I don't know what to say now, you were meant to be convinced by the proof.<br><br>

more importantly: a third party, looking at that conversation, goes away thinking "well, is 2+2 equal to 4? Don't know; there seem to be two sides to that argument", or worse, "man, I just don't care what 2+2 is because every time I try to find out there's just loads of shouting, so I'll stop asking".<br><br>

and thus, modern politics. Gaslighting and obfuscation, designed to make people believe that facts are disputable and that engagement is confusing and annoying.<br><br>

(Of course, part of the problem here is that our side have a habit of declaring things to be an actual fact when they're really "what we want to believe", and once one's cried wolf that way a few times, one's credibility is gone and it's really hard to get back. It's not all the other side's fault.)</blockquote>

<p>Normally I wouldn't re-post such a thing, but of course this conversation happened on Slack, which means that six months from now I won't be able to link to this because it'll be over 10,000 messages ago and Slack will be holding it to ransom until we pay money, and five years from now I won't be able to link to it because Slack will have gone bust or have been sold to someone and shut down.</p>
