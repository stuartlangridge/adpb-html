			<p>A two-decade-long search is over.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I wrote up the efforts required to <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2017/08/24/double-oh-seven/">recover a tiny sound demo for the Archimedes computer</a>. In there, I made brief mention of a sample from an Arc sound editor named Armadeus, of a man saying "the mask, the ray-traced pictures, and finally the wire-frame city". That wasn't an idle comment. <a href="http://whizzy.org">Bill</a> and I have been looking for that sample for twenty years.</p>
<p>You're thinking, I bet it's not been twenty years. And you would be wrong. <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/comp.sys.acorn.misc/3YhswrNrGSo/discussion">Here's Bill posting to <code>comp.sys.acorn</code> in 2003</a>, for a start.</p>
<p>My daughter knows about this sample. <a href="http://jonobacon.com">Jono</a> knows about it. I use the phrase as a microphone test sentence, the same way other people use "testing, testing, 1, 2". It's lived in my head since I was in middle school, there on the Arc machines in CL0, which was Computer Lab Zero. (There was a CL1, which had the BBC Micros in it, on the first floor. I never did know whether CL0, which was on the ground floor, was a subtle joke about floor levels and computers' zero-based numbering schemes, or if Mr Irons the teacher was just weird. He might have been weird. He thought the name for an exclamation mark was "pling".)</p>
<p>Anyway, we got to talking about it again, and Bill said: to hell with this, I'll just buy Armadeus. This act of selfless heroism earns him a gold medal. And a pint, yes it does. I'll let him tell the story about that, and the mindblowing worthlessness of modern floppy drives, in his own time. But today it arrived, and now I have an mp3!</p>
<p><audio src="https://kryogenix.org/random/themask.mp3" controls>
    <a href="https://kryogenix.org/random/themask.mp3">The ray-traced pictures. The mask. And finally, the wire-frame city.</a>
</audio></p>
<p>Interestingly, I thought it was in the other order. The sample actually says: "The ray-traced pictures. The mask. And finally, the wire-frame city." I thought "the mask" was first, and it isn't. Still, memory plays tricks on you after this many years. Apparently it's from a Clares sound and music demo originally (Clares were the (defunct) company that made Armadeus. The name appears to have risen from the dead a couple of times since. No idea who they are now, if anyone.) Anyway, I don't care; I've got it now. And it's on my website, which means it will never go away. We found it once before and then lost the sample; I'm not making the same mistake again. Is this how Indy felt when he found the Ark?</p>
<p>Also, a shout out to <a href="http://arcem.sourceforge.net/">arcem</a>, which is an Archimedes emulator which runs fine on Ubuntu. It's a pain in the bum to set up -- you have to compile it, find ROMs, turn on sound support, use weird keypresses, set up hard drives in an incomprehensible text file, etc; someone ought to snap it or something so it's easier -- but it's been rather nice revisiting a lot of the <a href="http://www.apdl.org.uk/apdlpd/library/library.htm">Arc software</a> that's still collected and around for download. Desktop sillies. Someone should bring desktop sillies back to modern desktops. And reconnecting to <a href="http://arcade-bbs.net">Arcade BBS</a>, who need to fix all their FTP links to point to <code>telnet.arcade-bbs.net</code> rather than the now-dead <code>arcade.demon.co.uk</code>. I got to watch !DeskDuck again, which was a small mallard duck that swum up and down along the top of your icon bar. And a bunch of old demos from BIA and Arcangel and so on. I'd forgotten a bit how much I liked RISC OS, and in particular that it's <em>so fast</em> to start up. Bring that back.</p>
<p>Nice one Bill. Time for a pint.</p>
