		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been looking at single-page-app frameworks and not keen on any of them. The list at http://todomvc.com/ has a bunch, and I think I&#8217;ve rejected them all &#8212; I concede that some of these reasons are just flat-out prejudice or reasonably baseless bad feelings or seem pretty trivial to whoever&#8217;s reading, so this is your chance to talk me into something you think is good and show me why my bad feelings are unjustified or&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like is two-way data binding, routing, and some notion of making separate isolated components. I don&#8217;t have a pure <span class="caps">REST</span> put/delete/get <span class="caps">API</span> to back end onto, and I do not want a &#8220;framework&#8221; which has as a selling point that you can switch different routing or template components in and out; if I&#8217;m assembling my own preferences out of bits, then I won&#8217;t use a framework at all; I&#8217;ll stitch them together myself. The point of using a framework is exactly that it does everything, and I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span> with using the framework&#8217;s methods to do X, Y, and Z, rather than cursing because I want to use a different routing library. I am a large believer in identifying the approach that a particular tool takes, and not using the tool if what you want to do doesn&#8217;t match that approach, even if it&#8217;s possible to use the tool in ways other than its expected that you will. Every time I&#8217;ve done this in the past I&#8217;ve ended up being burned by it. The thing I want is to identify something which wants to do the things I plan, and then use it; not to find something which doesn&#8217;t want to work that way and then make it work that way&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>So, convince me I&#8217;m wrong on your preferred choice from this list, or mention something I don&#8217;t know about. And yes, I could write my own, but I&#8217;m massively resistant to that because that just makes the another-day-another-framework problem even&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>There is one non-negotiable rule: JavaScript. No other languages which compile to JavaScript. I don&#8217;t mind things like React&#8217;s <span class="caps">JSX</span>, because that&#8217;s being used to write <span class="caps">HTML</span> (although I&#8217;m not sure about it), but no Coffeescript libraries,&nbsp;please.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Backbone.js</em> - also requires underscore and jquery. Some ideal thing for this really ought to be self-contained. Concerned about &#8220;is pre-configured to sync with a RESTful <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221; too, and I have to plug in my own choice of templating&nbsp;library.</li>
<li><em>AngularJS</em> - used it in the past for things. It makes me sad. There&#8217;s too much magic; it&#8217;s fine until something doesn&#8217;t work, and then you have to reverse-engineer all the&nbsp;magic.</li>
<li><em>Ember.js</em> - is massive and confuses the hell out of me. I did a bit of hacking on Discourse, which is Ember, and it took me about a day just to work out how to change the simplest&nbsp;thing.</li>
<li><em>KnockoutJS</em> - seems way, way verbose. <code>function AppViewModel() { this.firstName = ko.observable("Bert"); this.fullName = ko.computed(function() { ... }, this); } ko.applyBindings(new AppViewModel());</code>, seriously? Gnah. I hate&nbsp;that.</li>
<li><em>Dojo</em> - old. I never liked it the first time around, really, and I have the feeling that the zeitgeist has not gone with&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><em><span class="caps">YUI</span></em> - old, and pretty much abandoned upstream afaik. Used it at Canonical; &#8220;aspect-oriented programming&#8221; is basically computed <span class="caps">COME</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> from Intercal, which puts invisible trapdoors in your code so following the thread of control is hell on&nbsp;legs.</li>
<li><em>Knockback.js</em> - builds on Knockout, so see&nbsp;knockout.</li>
<li><em>CanJS</em> - models stuff seems specifically designed to back end to a put/get/delete rest <span class="caps">API</span>, which I don&#8217;t&nbsp;have.</li>
<li><em>Polymer</em> - seems like it may be ropy on iOS. Also, it has a nice big library of pre-built components, which is great, but they&#8217;re all Material Design components, which is not great at all; I&#8217;m not putting an Android-themed app on other platforms, for the same reason I wouldn&#8217;t put an app which looks like iOS on&nbsp;Android.</li>
<li><em>React</em> - I fear React. It seems to be the popular thing, but it&#8217;s very much a thing where one steps out of the world and into the React World instead. Have spoken to a number of people using it for real projects and I don&#8217;t like the idea of&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><em>Mithril</em> - I utterly utterly do not understand the <code>m.prop</code> stuff. I don&#8217;t know whether the docs explain it badly or I&#8217;m just not getting it, but I completely cannot grasp the Zen of Mithril. Shame, because it looks cool, if I could get it, which I&nbsp;can&#8217;t.</li>
<li><em>Ampersand</em> - I&#8217;m in two minds about the &#8220;it&#8217;s a zillion small libraries&#8221; thing. More to the point, I have no sense of how to structure the overall application; individual bits I can see how to do, but I don&#8217;t have a good sense of how to put it&nbsp;together</li>
<li><em>Flight</em> - I&#8217;m not sure this is the right thing for new apps. For restructuring an existing thing, I think it&#8217;d be good, but I&#8217;m building from&nbsp;scratch.</li>
<li><em>Vue.js</em> - doesn&#8217;t do routing or provide large-scale structure; they have some notes saying &#8220;hey, that means you can do it your way&#8221; which I don&#8217;t want to&nbsp;do</li>
<li><em>MarionetteJS</em> - depends on Backbone, so see&nbsp;Backbone.</li>
<li><em>TroopJS + RequireJS</em> - lots of dependencies. I do not get how to actually structure an application with it, and the docs are not helpful at&nbsp;this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I were happy about any of these. To be honest, my secret worry is that all frameworks are either incomplete, so I don&#8217;t want them, or do do everything I want but are consequentially too magical and so I don&#8217;t like them. I hope I&#8217;m wrong and there&#8217;s either something I&#8217;ve missed or a framework I don&#8217;t know about.
