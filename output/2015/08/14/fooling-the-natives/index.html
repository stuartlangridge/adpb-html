			<blockquote>"It's not death if you refuse it." -- <em>The 
Crow</em></blockquote>

<p>Over the last two weeks I have, inadvertently, 
conducted a very enlightening experiment on myself. I don't think 
it's repeatable or replicable -- like gods interfering with free 
will or The Truman Show, the experiment doesn't work if you know 
you're inside it -- but it's rather illustrative. </p>
<p>I'm a Google+ user<sup id="sf-fooling-the-natives-1-back"><a href="#sf-fooling-the-natives-1" class="simple-footnote" title="until they shut it down, which I hope they don't do">1</a></sup>. 
And the Android G+ app has been doing this annoying thing 
recently<sup id="sf-fooling-the-natives-2-back"><a href="#sf-fooling-the-natives-2" class="simple-footnote" title="since I switched phones from my old Nexus 4 with dodgy  wifi to the newer Nexus 4 which used to be my daughter's">2</a></sup> where 
if I pull down to get new posts, sometimes it doesn't work. Opening 
the side menu and closing it again always fixed it, so I put it down 
to some sort of bug in the G+ app and waited for it to be fixed. 
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+StuartLangridge/posts/eZZxGkUj94L">Not very 
patiently.</a> </p>
<p>Other people reportedly didn't have the problem, so I just put it 
down to weirdness and carried on. Well. I've just, this moment, 
realised why. When I first factory reset this phone and then started 
it up for the first time, I didn't use the G+ app. I used the G+ 
website and bookmarked it to my home screen. And then, it seems, I 
forgot that I'd done it. </p>
<p>The actual app doesn't have the problem. </p>
<p>This is interesting in two ways. </p>
<p>The first and most obvious conclusion is that the web app isn't quite as good as the native 
app. Obvious conclusion to draw, and also obviously correct; it had 
a bug that the native app didn't, and one could reasonably make the 
case that it had that bug <em>because</em> it's a web app and not native. </p>
<p>But. I used the thing constantly for a couple of weeks without 
realising it <em>was</em> a web app. At no point other than this bug did it 
betray that it was anything other than the G+ app. Now I compare the 
two side by side, there are differences, but I didn't notice them as 
being worse, or even different; I just used the app and it never 
occurred to me to question it. More importantly, at no point did the 
bug make me think that it was because I was using a web app, or 
question the nature of the app. Plenty of people will say that 
they've used web apps and found bugs and therefore web apps are bad. 
But I wonder how much that would get said if those people hadn't 
<em>known</em> they were using a web app? I just put it down to an app bug; 
it never occurred to me that it might be because it's in JavaScript 
rather than Java, and at no other point and in no other way did the 
G+ web app give me cause to suspect or even question that it was 
anything other than the native app. </p>
<p>Now, this is not always the 
case, by any stretch of the imagination. The Google team put a 
<em>lot</em> of effort into their web stuff. Most "web apps" betray their 
true nature constantly. But this shows it's basically <em>possible</em>. If 
you don't have the easy, lazy fallback of blaming any issues on a 
thing being of the web, then you don't necessarily think of that as 
being a problem itself. </p>
<p>This is encouraging.</p><ol class="simple-footnotes"><li id="sf-fooling-the-natives-1">until they shut it down, which I hope they don't do <a href="#sf-fooling-the-natives-1-back" class="simple-footnote-back">↩</a></li><li id="sf-fooling-the-natives-2">since I switched phones from my old Nexus 4 with dodgy
