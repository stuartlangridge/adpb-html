			<p>So, Lazyweb, I come to you for assistance. This is one of those posts
where I describe what I want, I describe all the ways I&#8217;ve thought of of
doing it and what&#8217;s wrong with them, you my glorious readers come up
with a bunch of new ways, and then I reveal all the other conditions
that I forgot to mention initially which invalidate your ideas&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I have my fingers crossed that it&#8217;ll work better than that, though. You
lot are pretty&nbsp;clever.</p>
<p>So, I have in my house a laptop running Ubuntu, a mobile phone running
Meego, and a <span class="caps">TV</span> computer running Ubuntu and <span class="caps">XBMC</span>. There&#8217;s also my
daughter&#8217;s mobile, running Android. We listen to music and watch <span class="caps">TV</span> from
those devices. I would like to solve the following&nbsp;problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>My laptop speakers are a bit crap for listening to good music; I
    would like to play music from my laptop through some external&nbsp;speakers</li>
<li>When I&#8217;m in the kitchen making tea, I can&#8217;t hear music being played
    by my phone over the noise of the kettle&nbsp;boiling</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t hear music being played from my phone or sound from the <span class="caps">TV</span>
    computer when I&#8217;m in the shower&nbsp;either</li>
<li>My daughter likes playing her music in the living&nbsp;room</li>
<li>If I start playing music or an audiobook on my laptop and then go
    upstairs for ten minutes I&#8217;d like the music to keep playing but from
    speakers upstairs rather than the ones in my&nbsp;office</li>
<li>I <em>hate</em> plugging cables in and out of&nbsp;things</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want sound to come from all speakers at once&nbsp;always</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s the problem. Here are solutions I have thought of, along with why
I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re quite&nbsp;right.</p>
<h3>Buy Sonos or Squeezebox gear or something&nbsp;similar</h3>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>. This&#8217;d work, but I don&#8217;t want to do it. Partially my reasoning for
this is that I end up locked in to whoever I go for &#8212; it means that I
have to continue buying their gear forever if I want new speakers and so
on &#8212; and partially because my distinct inclination here is to have <em>the
speakers be stupid</em>. I don&#8217;t want clever speakers; the Sonos or whatever
stuff tend to make the speakers be clever devices which know how to
connect to Spotify themselves, and then you use the magic protocol to
tell a speaker what to do. That&#8217;s a bad model; I think that the
cleverness should be in the thing that <em>streams</em> the music (my laptop,
my phone, Niamh&#8217;s phone, whatever) and the speaker is just a dumb
speaker which receives audio somehow and plays it and that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t
want to configure each speaker to talk to my music repository &#8212; a
clever speaker has to itself know how to play all the music I want. It
won&#8217;t very easily do, for example, error sounds from my laptop. I don&#8217;t
have a Sonos client for my Nokia N9. Etc. Stupid speakers: clever
devices. That&#8217;s my plan. I don&#8217;t want to have to use, for example, a
special music player on my phone because that&#8217;s the music player which
knows how to control a&nbsp;Squeezebox.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi, pulseaudio, <span class="caps">DLNA</span>, and <span class="caps">USB</span> wireless&nbsp;audio</h3>
<p>The idea here is that you have one computer &#8212; in my case it&#8217;d be a
Raspberry Pi, because I&#8217;ve <em>got</em> one already &#8212; connected to the
network. All the other devices &#8212; phones, laptops, whatever &#8212; stream
their sound output to the RasPi, either using pulseaudio&#8217;s network stuff
or by <span class="caps">DLNA</span>. The RasPi then has something like an <a href="http://audioengineusa.com/Store/Audioengine-W3">Audioengine W3</a> <span class="caps">USB</span>
wireless audio device plugged into it &#8212; the W3 is a <span class="caps">USB</span> transmitter and
separate receiver, where the transmitter is a little <span class="caps">USB</span> dongle and the
receiver is a powered box with a 3.5mm audio jack output on it. In
essence, this is a <span class="caps">USB</span>-audio-to-headphone-jack adapter, it&#8217;s just
wireless. So phones and laptops stream audio to the RasPi; the RasPi
then plays audio over <span class="caps">USB</span>, and the W3 takes care of wirelessly sending
that audio to speakers. This is a nice idea; it means that I can buy any
speakers I like and as long as I plug a W3 receiver into them, they&#8217;ll
work fine for this plan, and it means that any device in the house can
play through the speakers as long as it can do either pulseaudio or
<span class="caps">DLNA</span>, and I think anything I care about can. The <em>flaw</em> with this plan
is that although a W3 can transmit to up to three speakers at once, I
don&#8217;t believe that it can be paired with three speakers but only
transmit to two of them. So this would play sound through all the
speakers at once. I could avoid that by buying one W3
transmitter/receiver pair for each speaker (and then running a little
web app on the RasPi which allows you to select <em>which</em> <span class="caps">USB</span> audio thing
to output through, but that&#8217;s bloody expensive, and W3 transmitters are
meant to be six inches apart which they wouldn&#8217;t be if plugged into a
RasPi, even with a <span class="caps">USB</span>&nbsp;hub.</p>
<h3>Many&nbsp;RasPis</h3>
<p>You have one RasPi, as above, which everyone streams music to. Then you
have one more RasPi per speaker; the central-RasPi then
pulseaudio-streams music to a chosen speaker-RasPi over wifi. This would
work fine, except that the RasPi isn&#8217;t great in this sort of environment
for wifi. I&#8217;m fine with the one central RasPi being wired ethernet &#8212; I
can just stick it next to the router &#8212; but the speaker RasPis would
need to be wireless, and that means a wireless <span class="caps">USB</span> dongle. Wireless
dongles draw more power than the RasPis <span class="caps">USB</span> port can provide, which
means that each speaker would need a powered hub as well, meaning that
each speaker now needs its own power cable, the RasPi&#8217;s power cable, and
the powered hub&#8217;s power cable. That&#8217;s a lot of messy cables. I&#8217;m sure
it&#8217;d be possible to do something clever to avoid this by taking power
from multiple places or doing soldering or a bunch of <span class="caps">USB</span> Y-cables or
something, but that sounds pretty&nbsp;hard.</p>
<h3>AirPlay</h3>
<p>I could buy Apple AirPlay-compatible speakers. Pulseaudio can stream to
them, and that&#8217;d work. I&#8217;m not very keen on this idea; open source
support for Apple stuff has a habit of stopping working when Apple
invent a new protocol version deliberately to break third-party support
for it, it&#8217;s not at all clear how I&#8217;d stream from, say, my phone&#8217;s
audiobook player to them (see above about &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have to use a
special music client&#8221;), and it means that I&#8217;m locked in to buying
AirPlay stuff for&nbsp;ever.</p>
<h3>&#8230;other&nbsp;ideas</h3>
<p>So, as you can see, I&#8217;m not totally happy with any of these. If there
were a wifi-capable RasPi then I&#8217;d probably go the &#8220;many RasPis&#8221; route.
Failing that, I&#8217;m not really sure, so I&#8217;m coming to the Lazyweb for
ideas. Tell me how <em>you</em> think I should do it, and I&#8217;ll happily&nbsp;listen!</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you could just buy a little box that you plug
into the speaker with a 3.5mm jack cable, and if you have five of these
little boxes they coordinate amongst themselves and offer one web <span class="caps">UI</span> to
select which speakers are powered on, and one of them becomes the
&#8220;leader&#8221; and appears on the network as a <span class="caps">DLNA</span> and pulseaudio destination
and takes care of streaming to the others? That would even be doable,
and they&#8217;d be sweet &#8212; it&#8217;s basically &#8220;many RasPis&#8221;, above, as a
commercial product. Sounds like a thing that might go down well on&nbsp;Kickstarter&#8230;</p>
