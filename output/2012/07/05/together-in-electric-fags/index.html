			<p>Those of you who have spent some time in my company, or even a few
seconds in my company, will be aware that I'm a smoker. Now, there are
those who smoke because they're addicted, and those who smoke because
they were seduced into it at a young age, and those who smoke because
they're sick and tired of the pious mouthings of health Nazi whiners who
wouldn't know fun if it fell out of a tree onto their heads, but me... I
enjoy it. This may seem hard to believe, but I swear it's the truth. I'm
not here doing a commercial for Marlboro. Smoking's nice. You can tell
this by looking at the vast array of people who don't smoke unless
they're out having a drink: that is, while they're having an
entertaining evening.</p>
<p>There are, however, some downsides to this glorious world of tobacco.
Chief among them is, of course, an early and appalling death, and when
you add that it's expensive, anti-social, unpleasant-smelling,
inconvenient, repulsive, annoying, inconsiderate, and nowhere near as
rebellious as every smoker thinks it is, there's not a lot going for the
whole concept.</p>
<p>Apart from the whole enjoyment thing, as noted, and that's (ha!) the
killer app for the whole fags idea. Beyonc√© knows this: that's why she
did a song with the lyric "all the cigarettes, all the cigarettes,
woah-oh-oh, a-woah-ho-oh". Anyway, after a lifetime of smoking, it
occurred to me I should probably do something about it. Combined with
this, with Jungian synchronicity, came a number of things, one of which
was a memory of seeing Otto "<a href="http://twitter.com/chaotic">chaotic</a>" Greenslade smoking an electric
cigarette with evidence of enjoyment. Now, if I'm prepared to spend
money on <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/amnesia/">games for Ubuntu that might not even work on my crappy integrated graphics card</a>, electric cigarettes ought to be a shoo-in.
After some poking around on the internet, it turns out that there are a
zillion different companies in this whole e-fags game. I picked <a href="http://www.smokerelief.co.uk/">Smoke Relief</a>, because they seemed sane and they're in the UK. (I have no
connection with these people, other than being a satisfied customer.)</p>
<p>The way electric cigarettes work, for those of you who haven't come
across these items, is that you get a thing which looks like a cigarette
but is actually a battery (the long white bit) and a little reservoir of
the magic fluid (the brown bit that looks like a filter) which screws
into it. The battery charges from a USB port, can you believe it? And
the magic fluid is a combination of glycerine (which is apparently
harmless, because it's the stuff they use in smoke machines in
nightclubs), nicotine (because, well, addicted) and some sort of
flavouring. The Smoke Relief people do a "starter pack" (Benson and
Hedges should take some tips here) which only costs a tenner, so you can
give it a go for the cost of one box of cigarettes. One of the little
reservoirs of magic is about equivalent to a pack of fags, you get five
of the reservoirs in the starter pack, and the flavours are interesting
-- peach, cherry, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>So I bought a starter pack, and approached the whole thing with a
gargantuan cascade of scepticism, and... that turned out to be, for me
at least, entirely unfounded. I've now been smoking electric cigarettes
for a month, and it's just <em>fine</em> as far as I can tell. They cost
considerably less, they don't make your room smell, and you don't die
horribly of lung cancer, so there's just not a lot of failure points
here. Smoking's nice (you may disagree, but whatever), and smoking these
is <em>just as nice</em>, in my not-so-humble opinion; the <em>experience</em> is --
amazingly, surprisingly -- just the same as real fags.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of nutters out there -- the same sort of people who
refill printer cartridges rather than buying new ones, and who
presumably eat discarded food from litter bins because it's cheaper --
who will recommend that you mix your own magic fluid to save money. That
seems to me like way, way, way too much effort. If you're a smoker (and
therefore basically a cool person -- we're Bohemians; the last of the
breed), you owe it to yourself to chuck down a tenner on one box of
electric fags. If you hate it after two days, go back out and buy twenty
Rothmans. But I bet you won't. My books are now digital rather than
paper, my mail is electronic rather than printed, my phone calls are GSM
rather than copper wires, and now my cigarettes are too. Twenty-first
century boy.</p>
