			<p>Those of you who have spent some time in my company, or even a few
seconds in my company, will be aware that I&#8217;m a smoker. Now, there are
those who smoke because they&#8217;re addicted, and those who smoke because
they were seduced into it at a young age, and those who smoke because
they&#8217;re sick and tired of the pious mouthings of health Nazi whiners who
wouldn&#8217;t know fun if it fell out of a tree onto their heads, but me&#8230; I
enjoy it. This may seem hard to believe, but I swear it&#8217;s the truth. I&#8217;m
not here doing a commercial for Marlboro. Smoking&#8217;s nice. You can tell
this by looking at the vast array of people who don&#8217;t smoke unless
they&#8217;re out having a drink: that is, while they&#8217;re having an
entertaining&nbsp;evening.</p>
<p>There are, however, some downsides to this glorious world of tobacco.
Chief among them is, of course, an early and appalling death, and when
you add that it&#8217;s expensive, anti-social, unpleasant-smelling,
inconvenient, repulsive, annoying, inconsiderate, and nowhere near as
rebellious as every smoker thinks it is, there&#8217;s not a lot going for the
whole&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>Apart from the whole enjoyment thing, as noted, and that&#8217;s (ha!) the
killer app for the whole fags idea. Beyoncé knows this: that&#8217;s why she
did a song with the lyric &#8220;all the cigarettes, all the cigarettes,
woah-oh-oh, a-woah-ho-oh&#8221;. Anyway, after a lifetime of smoking, it
occurred to me I should probably do something about it. Combined with
this, with Jungian synchronicity, came a number of things, one of which
was a memory of seeing Otto &#8220;<a href="http://twitter.com/chaotic">chaotic</a>&#8221; Greenslade smoking an electric
cigarette with evidence of enjoyment. Now, if I&#8217;m prepared to spend
money on <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/amnesia/">games for Ubuntu that might not even work on my crappy integrated graphics card</a>, electric cigarettes ought to be a shoo-in.
After some poking around on the internet, it turns out that there are a
zillion different companies in this whole e-fags game. I picked <a href="http://www.smokerelief.co.uk/">Smoke Relief</a>, because they seemed sane and they&#8217;re in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. (I have no
connection with these people, other than being a satisfied&nbsp;customer.)</p>
<p>The way electric cigarettes work, for those of you who haven&#8217;t come
across these items, is that you get a thing which looks like a cigarette
but is actually a battery (the long white bit) and a little reservoir of
the magic fluid (the brown bit that looks like a filter) which screws
into it. The battery charges from a <span class="caps">USB</span> port, can you believe it? And
the magic fluid is a combination of glycerine (which is apparently
harmless, because it&#8217;s the stuff they use in smoke machines in
nightclubs), nicotine (because, well, addicted) and some sort of
flavouring. The Smoke Relief people do a &#8220;starter pack&#8221; (Benson and
Hedges should take some tips here) which only costs a tenner, so you can
give it a go for the cost of one box of cigarettes. One of the little
reservoirs of magic is about equivalent to a pack of fags, you get five
of the reservoirs in the starter pack, and the flavours are interesting
&#8212; peach, cherry, that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>So I bought a starter pack, and approached the whole thing with a
gargantuan cascade of scepticism, and&#8230; that turned out to be, for me
at least, entirely unfounded. I&#8217;ve now been smoking electric cigarettes
for a month, and it&#8217;s just <em>fine</em> as far as I can tell. They cost
considerably less, they don&#8217;t make your room smell, and you don&#8217;t die
horribly of lung cancer, so there&#8217;s just not a lot of failure points
here. Smoking&#8217;s nice (you may disagree, but whatever), and smoking these
is <em>just as nice</em>, in my not-so-humble opinion; the <em>experience</em> is &#8212;
amazingly, surprisingly &#8212; just the same as real&nbsp;fags.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of nutters out there &#8212; the same sort of people who
refill printer cartridges rather than buying new ones, and who
presumably eat discarded food from litter bins because it&#8217;s cheaper &#8212;
who will recommend that you mix your own magic fluid to save money. That
seems to me like way, way, way too much effort. If you&#8217;re a smoker (and
therefore basically a cool person &#8212; we&#8217;re Bohemians; the last of the
breed), you owe it to yourself to chuck down a tenner on one box of
electric fags. If you hate it after two days, go back out and buy twenty
Rothmans. But I bet you won&#8217;t. My books are now digital rather than
paper, my mail is electronic rather than printed, my phone calls are <span class="caps">GSM</span>
rather than copper wires, and now my cigarettes are too. Twenty-first
century&nbsp;boy.</p>
