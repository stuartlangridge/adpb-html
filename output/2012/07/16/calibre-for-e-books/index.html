		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I read a lot of e-books. The process by which I do this is as follows:
get an ePub from somewhere (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads">Project Gutenberg</a>, as ever, is a pretty
rich source of books, and most of their stuff is available in ePub
format), and add that book into <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. I marked my Calibre ebook
library as synced with Ubuntu One, so every time I add a book it's
uploaded to the cloud so I never lose it. Then I use <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/u1fn9/">Ubuntu One for
N9</a> to save the book onto my phone, and <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</a> automatically
picks that up and lets me read it.</p>
<p>Up until today, though, one of the things I didn't like about this
little process was that Calibre just looks rather awful. Calibre, the
Swiss Army knife of e-book management, does <em>everything</em>. It catalogues
your books, fetches correct metadata for them, lets you edit and rate
and fix and fiddle them, and a whole heap of stuff that I don't use but
that other people do like automatically downloading news and turning it
into a book, syncing to devices like a phone or kindle (I use U1 for
that), integrate with websites, and so on. But... it looks kinda
disorganised and all over the place, and that makes me sad. The Calibre
team have been pretty clear that to them, Calibre is a pro-level tool
and so any UI reorganisation which involves hiding half the functions is
not likely to pass muster; having said this, I'm fairly sure that if
someone rocked up with a fantastic new UI and was prepared to commit to
working on it or guiding development, they'd get a decent hearing; Kovid
Goyal, the lead developer, is ludicrously fast and responsive to
requests for changes. Now, I'm not a visual designer; I'm not a designer
at all, either, so changing the overall user experience of the app isn't
something I can credibly do. But I do know what <em>I personally</em> like,
which is stripped-down simple apps.</p>
<p>So for me, Calibre looks like this…</p>
<p><img alt="Calibre with only the cover browser showing and no toolbar" src="http://kryogenix.org/random/calibre-condensed.png"></p>
<p>…which, to my eyes, looks a lot neater. Doing this just requires poking
at Calibre's configuration a bit.</p>
<p>First, turn on the Cover Browser with the "arrow" button in the status
bar next to "Jobs". Then, turn <em>off</em> the Tag Browser and Book Details
view with the other two buttons, and drag the divider between the Cover
Browser and the book list downwards so that the book list is hidden.
Next, in Preferences &gt; Toolbar, customise the menu bar and add whatever
you want to it. Calibre ships by default with the menu bar empty on
Linux (but populated on OS X); here, we add the functions you care about
to the menu (which works correctly on Ubuntu as a menu in the Unity top
bar). Be sure and add "Preferences" to the menu! Finally, also in
Preferences &gt; Toolbar, edit the main toolbar and remove everything from
it (so it disappears). At that point, you've got a super-stripped-down
Calibre which still does everything you want but looks fairly slick.
Make whatever other changes you deem necessary!</p>
<p>At the moment it is sadly not possible to "export" your Calibre
configuration (so that people can swap configs around, which would make
it easy to test different ones and possibly make it easier to create a
"calibre-light" package for not-quite-as-pro-as-Pro-users which is
<em>still full Calibre</em> but a bit less button-heavy and intimidating. It'd
be pretty cool if that were possible; I've seen people talking about it
on the Calibre forums. Nonetheless, a bit of tweaking can make a
powerful app also be a pleasant-looking app, and you lose nothing in the
way of features; maybe Calibre with a nicer default UI could be a
flagship app for the Ubuntu desktop?</p>
