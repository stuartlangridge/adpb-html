		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Those of you who read technical news will likely have seen that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18338956">six
million hashed LinkedIn passwords were leaked today</a>. There's
obviously a worry here; was your own password leaked?</p>
<p>First: go change your LinkedIn password. It cannot hurt to do so
regardless. Some people are deleting their LinkedIn accounts over this,
but I'm not.</p>
<p>Second, you can check whether your password was leaked. People are
throwing together websites to do this: leakedin.org for one. They seem
like sensible people, and they carefully ensure that your password isn't
passed to their server, but it's bad practice to type your password into
someone else's website, secure or not, in my opinion. So here's how I
checked it myself.</p>
<p>The leaked password file is available for download. I got it from <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?n307hutksjstow3">a
MediaFire link</a>, found at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">Hacker News</a>, but that might be dead by
the time you go there. There seem to be a couple of different versions
out there. The one I got was a 116MB RAR archive file named
<code>SHA1.txt_1.rar</code>. Download it and click it to uncompress it; you should
get a file named <code>SHA1.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you've got that file, you can look for passwords in it. The
file (and what was stored at LinkedIn) isn't a list of passwords:
instead, it's a list of <em>hashes</em> of passwords; to hash a password, you
take that password and perform a mathematical transformation on it. So
the word "ubuntu" becomes the hash
"24bf68e341ce0fbd9259a5d51feed79682ea4eba". The important point about
hashing is that it's easy to go from "ubuntu" to
"24bf68e341ce0fbd9259a5d51feed79682ea4eba" but it's very hard to go
<em>back</em> again; you can't start with the hash and get the word.</p>
<p>However, the flaw here is that if you've got a big list of hashes, you
can just guess passwords and see if they're in the list. The way you're
meant to prevent this is by <em>salting</em> the passwords: that is, instead of
hashing "ubuntu" to get "24bf68e341ce0fbd9259a5d51feed79682ea4eba", you
invent some random characters, called the <code>salt</code>, and glue them on the
front of the password first, and then hash <em>that</em>, and then store the
hash: so you don't hash "ubuntu", you invent random characters "acjup",
and then hash "acjupubuntu" to get
"ec329e9cefc6138288b5baf1e25008da3f488ad8", something different... and
then in your password file you store the hash <em>and</em> the salt. This makes
guessing much harder. LinkedIn didn't do this, sadly enough. So, given
that you have a list of hashed passwords, you can guess a password and
see whether it's in the list. With your <code>SHA1.txt</code> file, try it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span>alongpasswordimadeup<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>shasum<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>cut<span class="w"> </span>-c6-40<span class="sb">`</span><span class="w"> </span>SHA1.txt$
</code></pre></div>

<p>That didn't show anything, so "alongpasswordimadeup" isn't one of the
leaked passwords. Let's try another:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>grep<span class="w"> </span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span>l1nked0ut<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>shasum<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>cut<span class="w"> </span>-c6-40<span class="sb">`</span><span class="w"> </span>SHA1.txt<span class="w"> </span>
e7bf10afef5f2ba94b104126d04db1837f423816
000000afef5f2ba94b104126d04db1837f423816
$
</code></pre></div>

<p>That <em>did</em> show something, so someone on LinkedIn had the password
"l1nked0ut", and it's been leaked. Worse, there are two hits: the
hackers seem to already be working on this file to guess passwords with
it, and ones that they've identified are in the file with the first five
characters overwritten with zeroes... so our unlucky l1nked0ut person is
doubly punished for their lack of imagination by having a password
leaked and having had it already guessed by the leakers. Oops.</p>
<p>So, to check your own password, do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w">  </span>grep<span class="w"> </span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span>yourpassword<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>shasum<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>cut<span class="w"> </span>-c6-40<span class="sb">`</span><span class="w"> </span>SHA1.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that there is an <em>extra space</em> before the word "grep": this means
that that command will not go into your command history (and so your
password won't be in there).</p>
<p>If a result shows... your password was leaked. Go and change it.</p>
<p>If you get no result... go and change your password anyway. And don't
use the same password as you use elsewhere.</p>
<p>Mine wasn't in it, pleasingly enough, although that's just luck.</p>
<p>If you want to understand this stuff more, read about encryption and
secure passwords and salting. There is much literature out there about
this stuff. (That is: don't treat my explanations above as gospel: read
real documentation from experts and understand!) It's disappointing that
LinkedIn made the schoolchild error of not salting stored passwords,
certainly. Let's hope that others learn from their mistake, if nothing
else.</p>
