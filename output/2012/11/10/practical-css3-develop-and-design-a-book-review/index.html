		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>Earlier this week, in an argument, someone pointed out that I have
hardly any books in my house. Not so, I retorted angrily. I've got
hundreds. They're just all in boxes in the shed, because I'm in the
process of moving
house.<span style="color: red" title="Long-term readers will be aware that this is being flexible-ish with the truth, but I am _trying_ to move">*</span></p>
<p>And it occurred to me: I haven't missed actually having the books
around. Much. Every now and again I'll rummage through a box and pull
out a book, mainly so the littlest room in my house has something to
read in it. But that's rare. And I got to thinking: actual books?
Really? Well, I read fiction, but non-fiction stuff, that's all on the
internet now. What's the point of a book, particularly a technical book?</p>
<p>Well, there is a distinction, I think, between reading stuff on the web,
as it arrives, in dribs and drabs, in no particular order… and actually
getting a good, solid overview of an area. A technical book isn't really
about new information: it's about organisation. About someone pulling
together a big pile of disparate stuff and making a consistent narrative
out of it. I'd almost forgotten, I think, the pleasure of having someone
else work out what's important and then distill it for me. When you read
a well-written technical book, you're the Prime Minister; your author is
collating a world of shades of grey into a succinct, crisp report so you
can understand what's going on.</p>
<p>This is a valuable service. More valuable than you may at first think.</p>
<p>It's also a valuable skill to have. It's not easy, taking a world full
of contradiction and making it clear. Book authorship is more than just
putting words in the right order and then buying a Lamborghini Aventador
with the proceeds, you know.</p>
<p>There's a lot going on with the web right now. People inventing specs,
browsers implementing them or not implementing them, the old order
changes, the centre cannot hold. I'm sure there are people who manage to
follow all of this — and I in turn follow them, on Twitter, normally —
but I mostly don't have the time or, to be frank, the inclination to
spend my life tracking the internecine wars. What I want to know, in the
words of <a href="https://twitter.com/fyrd">Alexis Deveria</a>'s <em>fantastic</em> site, is <a href="http://caniuse.com/">can I <em>use</em></a> this?</p>
<p>Which brings me to Chris Mills.</p>
<p>Now, Mills is a friend of mine, in addition to being basically a walking
metal
cliché<span style="color: red" title="his band is called Conquest of Steel. Which is at the same time unbearably close to parody and also TOTALLY METAL \m/">*</span>
and a thousand feet tall. We've spilled the same beer in the same mud,
to misquote Marines the world over. So, when he said he was writing
another book (this is a man who writes about the web for a living, so
there're a lot of words out there with his name on them), I was
interested. And, kindly, he spotted me a free copy of it, which is
appreciated.</p>
<p>And thus, <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/practical-css3-develop-and-design-9780133014679">Practical CSS3: Develop and Design</a> was born unto the
world, and borne unto me.</p>
<p>Given the whole books-in-boxes thing, I was pretty pleased to see that
there's an ebook version — and ePub to boot. No stupid, <em>stupid</em> Adobe
DRM crap here (well done Peachpit, the publishers, for <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/faq_nondrm.aspx">not locking the
book</a>; it is watermarked with my name, but I'm basically OK with
that). I could get the book and read it on my phone, which is where I
read everything these days, even in the littlest room. And that's how I
think technical books like this should be read; from cover to cover. Not
as reference; as entertainment, as something where you read a chapter
and then the ideas within it settle into your head to be dug out later.
Where you find yourself thinking, six months from now, "didn't I read
something about using rems for font sizing? Now where was that?" and
return to the book for details. It should be a seed of ideas, a
low-impedance way of getting All The New Stuff into your head and having
fun meanwhile.</p>
<p>Mills' book manages that with aplomb. Take rems, for example, since I
mentioned them earlier. I was — and I'm not kidding in the slightest
here — halfway through the section about sizing text in <em>rem</em> units
before I realised that it was serious and not some kind of huge
piss-take aimed at <a href="http://twitter.com/rem">Remy Sharp</a>. Not because Mills suggests it is in
any way, but because I was <em>enjoying</em> reading. Rems are real (as is
Remy). They're useful, too, and I'd never heard of them: a font-size in
<code>rem</code>s is relative to the size of your <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, not relative to
the size of the parent element. So all of this <code>font-size: 0.786em</code>
stuff goes away; you can now make text the size you want without having
to bust out some sort of calculator widget.</p>
<p>The book's eminently practical, too, explaining a bunch of stuff that's
going on right now (flexbox styling, responsive design, animations,
border-images) and giving sensible advice on actually using this stuff
via polyfills, fallback content, and the like. Unsurprisingly for
someone who works for Opera, Mills is not about pushing the latest
only-works-in-one-browser tricks; there are copious examples and
explanations about <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> to use a technique, rather than
just how.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing's perfect. ("Perfection is finality. Finality is
death. Nothing is perfect. There are lumps in it." as Peter S. Beagle
put it.) There are a couple of editing errors (references to things like
<code>transformX: translate(200px)</code> which ought to be
<code>transform: translateX(200px)</code>) which I'd have expected to be caught by
a technical editor; there's an animated form example (from the
(downloadable) set of code examples) which doesn't seem to work in
Firefox 16, which surprised me; and the thing's 35MB, which is pretty
large. But these are minor quibbles. If I were looking for a reason to
have a pop at Mills, I'd say that the whole section on making icons with
pure CSS, while it's alarmingly clever (and has been for a while; I was
blown away by <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-gui-icons/">Nicholas Gallagher's original pure CSS icons</a>), doesn't
really belong in a book which is careful to talk about semantics and
discourage adding a bunch of meaningless markup to your sites just to
get some presentational effect. But this is, at best, a venial sin
rather than mortal. I enjoyed reading the book; I learned from it — not
really the underlying world-view, with which I was already sympathetic,
but real detail about the cutting-edge of
CSS3<span style="color: red" title="not the bleeding edge">*</span>;
and I'm glad it exists. If you want to feel like the Prime Minister and
have your Secretary of State for CSS3 Stuff write you the report you
really need on what the web can do in 2012, you could do a lot worse
than Mills's <em>Practical CSS3: Develop and Design</em>.</p>
