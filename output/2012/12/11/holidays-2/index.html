			<p>So, there I was in&nbsp;Tenerife.</p>
<p>A few days away is no bad thing. I&#8217;ve seen people talk about burnout &#8212;
hell, I&#8217;ve seen people <em>burn out</em> &#8212; and I could feel myself wandering
close to that line. It&#8217;s been a stressful couple of&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>So I came to Tenerife. Sun, sea,&nbsp;sand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising, here. Although perhaps only for me. Hands up if you&#8217;ve
read the <em>Inspector Morse</em> books? One of the things that you&#8217;ll notice
is that book Morse is not <span class="caps">TV</span> Morse. Book Morse, in addition to his
superhuman Mary Sue ability to attract women, is explicitly a mixture of
the cultured and the coarse. That&#8217;s a pretty good description of how my
head&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>I mentioned to a few people that I was going to Tenerife. And there was
scorn on the responses. Not always obvious, but it was there. The idea
of sun all day and then dreadful clubs full of chavs all night aroused
feelings of hatred in&nbsp;some.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? Fuck those people. I like the idea of reading in a
hot beachside bar all day and then continuing to drink all evening. And
that&#8217;s precisely what I&#8217;ve been up to. Today my entire day was eating a
full English breakfast and then re-reading the first two Dresden Files
books. Stand there and tell me that you think that that&#8217;s a bad thing to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Well, I thought about Rachel too. But I&#8217;ll talk more about her later.
She&#8217;s wonderful. But&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Anyway, it put in perspective the idea that suffering is noble. That if
you fought hard to get your 90% solution that it must have been worth
the effort. That deliberately rejecting the world in order to do
something free but useless should in itself deserve&nbsp;applause.</p>
<p>This place is freewheeling. It&#8217;s happy. That&#8217;s not a bad&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>There are people who would say that easy happiness is a bad thing. That
suffering is needed to prove a point. That using software that doesn&#8217;t
do what you want is virtuous if that software is Free. That it&#8217;s more
important to do things the right way than to actually do what you&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<p>Like me. I used to think that. Then I bought an iPhone. And I learned
that a reasonable subset of my audience believes that I should be
deprived of niceness and instead substitute the righteous feeling I get
from using Free software instead. As if it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I have
a thing that does what I want: if I had a thing that involved free
software instead then I could ignore that I can&#8217;t do what I care about
and instead feel happy that at least I wasn&#8217;t doing what I wanted in a
Free&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Suffering earns no points. That you made your own life miserable because
of your beliefs is not a way that you score points over people who
didn&#8217;t. You are not somehow more virtuous because you suffered for your
ability to connect to wifi or create documents. You aren&#8217;t a better
person because you did that. Your opponents are not morally inferior.
All you&#8217;ve done is make your own life hard because you think that there
are landmines on the easy path. Maybe you&#8217;re right. But that you
suffered is not in itself a reason why we should listen to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are tensions under the surface here in Tenerife that I&#8217;m
unaware of. But I never see them. Take a tip from the Canarians. Being
easy is not a crime. Being deliberately difficult is not virtuous. And
if you think differently, maybe you should go on&nbsp;holiday.</p>
<p>I can recommend O&#8217;Neills in Playa de las Americas. Two pints for five&nbsp;euros.</p>
