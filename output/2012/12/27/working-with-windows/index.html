			<p>A friend of mine asked me for a favour &#8212; one of those favours which is
actually to do some technical support for them. But he&#8217;s a good bloke
and is good at the guitar, so I said &#8220;no problem&#8221;. He&#8217;s got a Roberts
<span class="caps">WM</span>-201 internet radio; it can play mp3 streams from online radio
stations. And&#8230;it can also play your local music, streamed from a <span class="caps">PC</span> on
your network. That&#8217;s what he wanted: the computer in the dining room
with all his music on, and to play that music on the Roberts radio in
the lounge. They&#8217;re both on the wifi network in his&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>The computer is running Windows <span class="caps">XP</span>. I haven&#8217;t touched Windows in Quite
Some Time, but I said I&#8217;d have a&nbsp;look.</p>
<p>Long story short: I failed. And am annoyed about it. I&#8217;m not really
looking for suggestions here: he&#8217;s not a particularly technical bloke,
so I can&#8217;t really pass on the suggestions to him, and he&#8217;s a few hundred
miles from me so I can&#8217;t try things out. This is more an ill-tempered
rant than anything else, but if anyone&#8217;s got any ideas <strong>that do not
involve him buying new stuff or installing different operating
systems</strong>, I&#8217;ll&nbsp;listen.</p>
<p>The Roberts radio thing has two ways of playing music from a source on
the network: it can connect to Windows shares, and it can connect to
UPnP music sources. So I tried UPnP&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player has the ability to share music by UPnP, and he
already has that installed, with his music in it. That seemed an obvious
place to start. So, I enabled music sharing, following the instructions.
The radio could not see the shared UPnP source. I also had an Android
tablet available, so I installed a UPnP browser on it and that couldn&#8217;t
see it either. I installed a UPnP browser on the Windows machine and
that <em>could</em> see the UPnP source, which suggests that the problem is not
in Windows Media Player: it&#8217;s some sort of network or firewall issue.
The Windows machine had at least two firewalls on it: Windows Firewall,
and McAfee. I disabled both: still nothing could see the UPnP source.
There is, as far as I can tell, no way to find out <em>why</em> a thing is
invisible. A noddy network diagnostic tool on the Android tablet
confirmed that <span class="caps">TCP</span> port 2869 was &#8220;open&#8221; (and other ports were &#8220;closed&#8221;);
I didn&#8217;t have easy access to any other diagnostic tools (I&#8217;d have
nmapped it from my Ubuntu machine if I had it, but I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>No idea what to try after that. I don&#8217;t know what might be causing it to
be invisible from outside. A photo frame which can browse UPnP sources
also failed to connect. I did think about installing a different UPnP
server, but all the Windows ones I looked at (Twonky, another one I
forget the name of) cost money, and there&#8217;s no&nbsp;MediaTomb.</p>
<p>So, I tried Windows Shares. I shared the music folder and allowed
network users to alter the files therein. An <span class="caps">SMB</span> browser on the Android
tablet <em>could</em> see and browse the share <em>if it connected as Anonymous</em>.
It could not when using a username and password because I didn&#8217;t know
which username and password to use! He doesn&#8217;t have a password set, and
his username has a space in. I tried connecting with the Android <span class="caps">SMB</span>
browser (AndSMB, if it makes a difference) using the username
(containing a space) and an empty password: it would not connect. I
don&#8217;t know how to find out what your username is on Windows; I poked
around at &#8220;net user&#8221; and &#8220;net share&#8221; without enlightenment. I tried
changing his username to not have a space in, and setting a password,
and then connecting from AndSMB with that username and password: didn&#8217;t
work. The radio did not find any shares at all. I do not know whether
the radio tries connecting as Anonymous, and the documentation doesn&#8217;t
say. I tried using the username and password from the radio and that
didn&#8217;t work either. By the look of it, when you tell AndSMB to connect
as Anonymous, it actually connects with username &#8220;guest&#8221; and password
&#8220;&#8221;, so I tried that from the radio and it didn&#8217;t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m lost. And this is way too hard. And every time something like
this happens, I think he gets a little closer to buying a Mac.&nbsp;Sigh.</p>
<p>I may take an Ubuntu <span class="caps">CD</span> round at some&nbsp;point.</p>
