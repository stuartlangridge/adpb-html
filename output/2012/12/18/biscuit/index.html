			<p>Fresh from the <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/">Pastry Box</a> reject bin! For the last year, I've been
part of The Pastry Box, a series of short daily essays about the tech
world, the web, philosophy, and similar things. For December's essay I
wrote two and couldn't decide between them. One <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/stuart-langridge/2012-december-18/">about creativity and
the nature of being lost</a> was published today, and I didn't want the
other to just vanish, so here it is.</p>
<ol>
<li>While I was in my first year at university, Portishead released
    Dummy, the greatest album the world has ever known. Now, admittedly,
    I was at that point in my life as impressionable as a dollop of warm
    wax, but my liking was also influenced by how it is <em>the greatest
    album the world has ever known</em>.</li>
<li>I had a cassette copy of it made by my friend Andy which I played
    obsessively. All the time. Over and over again. And, for some
    reason, that cassette copy didn't have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiT0fBePR0Q">Biscuit</a> on it. To this
    day I do not know why.</li>
<li>And to this day, I don't like Biscuit as much as the rest of the
    album.</li>
<li>What you say matters, but what you leave out also matters.<br>
   *If you are a designer, go to 5. If you are a public speaker, go to<ol>
<li>If you are neither, go to 7. To open the door and attack the
beast, go to 11.*</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>"Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away", right?
    But Brillat-Savarin said: A dessert without cheese is like a
    beautiful woman with only one eye. In this age of minimalism, of
    stripped-down and stripped-out experiences, of getting what you need
    right there with no extraneous clutter, be careful we're not serving
    the dessert without cheese.<br>
<em>To continue, go to 8.</em></li>
<li>A philosopher once said: with great power comes great
    responsibility. This happens <strong>even if you don't want the great
    power</strong>. It happens even if you don't think you've got it. Someone
    looks up to you. If you leave things out when you talk to people,
    they'll think it's OK to leave them out too. They'll think it's not
    important, because you obviously don't think it is. It doesn't
    matter if in your heart you know it's important. You have to find a
    way of talking about it without ruining your elegant simplicity.
    That's why they pay you the big bucks. Even when they don't.<br>
<em>To continue, go to 8.</em></li>
<li>Read them both.</li>
<li>Now go back and read the other one.</li>
<li>And: don't worry about it. Expert Persian carpet makers used to
    deliberately drop a stitch, because to make something of flawless
    perfection would be to challenge the perfection of Allah. We can't
    all be right all the time. It's only the web. It's only our world.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Not that important.  </p>
<p>Right?</p>
