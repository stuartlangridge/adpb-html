</blockquote>
<p>So, I bought an&nbsp;iPhone.</p>
<p>Those of you who have known me for a while might be surprised by&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>My history with phones is long and detailed and very, very
idiosyncratic. I do not expect my reasons for wanting a thing to apply
to anyone else. Don&#8217;t see this as a prescriptive essay telling you what
you should do, because it isn&#8217;t. End of&nbsp;caveat.</p>
<p>After some considerable time using various phones I think I&#8217;ve defined
the criteria, the things I want from a phone, as three: <strong>beauty</strong>,
<strong>vitality</strong>, and <strong>openness</strong>. <strong>Beauty</strong> is about the software and the
hardware together: does the thing <em>feel</em> pleasurable to hold, to use, to
work with? <strong>Vitality</strong> is about the community: are there loads of apps?
Is there competition so individual apps get better? Do bugs get fixed?
When new things arrive, do they arrive on this platform? And
<strong>openness</strong> is about stuff that the platform <em>prevents</em> you from doing:
are there things that only certain magic anointed apps can do? Can I use
this device from Ubuntu? Can I build apps without buying the one
specific choice of <span class="caps">IDE</span> which doesn&#8217;t work on my laptop? Are there things
which ought to work but don&#8217;t because they compete with the platform
vendor&#8217;s business&nbsp;model?</p>
<p>This, in the words of the old joke, is one of those &#8220;three things: you
can choose any two&#8221;&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>Android, and Android phones, have vitality and openness, but not beauty.
(Idiosyncratic definition, remember. If you&#8217;re just about to tell me
that you think the Nexus 4 is beautiful, I don&#8217;t care; I don&#8217;t think it
is. Disagreeing here is like telling someone you don&#8217;t think their
husband is attractive; they&#8217;re not interested in your opinion.) I find
Android to be inconsistent, incohesive, and annoying (with more detail
<a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/04/my-new-phone-2012-edition">9 months ago</a> if you want to read back). You are welcome to feel
differently; you probably don&#8217;t share my taste in clothes either.
(Hardware beauty is achieved in Android phones solely in my opinion by
Sony with the Xperia range, but that doesn&#8217;t help the software. And Sony
have a long-term record of unopenness, which is why I don&#8217;t buy their&nbsp;stuff.)</p>
<p>The Nokia N9&#8230; openness and beauty, no problem. I loved, and still
love, the N9 hardware, and I love the software too. Swiping to switch
between apps, that&#8217;s great. Three home screens, great. The feed, great.
Applications that background explicitly rather than the phone thinking
it knows better than I do about when to kill an app, great. Accessories
that fit with the device and share design themes, great. But vitality is
not with the platform. It&#8217;s decapitated upstream, and half the community
don&#8217;t want to build great things on it; they want to build it itself. So
there are not many apps, and there&#8217;s not much competition. So you don&#8217;t
get Shazam. You don&#8217;t get Google+. The web browser is mildly deficient
but more importantly isn&#8217;t tested, so things like Grooveshark&#8217;s <span class="caps">HTML5</span>
version don&#8217;t work. There are great apps for N9 (most of which are
written by Thomas Perl ;)), and there&#8217;s nothing <em>technical</em> which stops
it from being great. It just didn&#8217;t take off. You can name reasons for
that until the cows come home &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t supported right by Nokia,
it&#8217;s too difficult to write apps, it wasn&#8217;t available in the right
countries, being open-source actually turns people off, the community
are too busy hacking the <span class="caps">OS</span> to build great things &#8212; but the reason
doesn&#8217;t matter. It didn&#8217;t take off, and so the limitations I find in it
are very unlikely to be&nbsp;fixed.</p>
<p>And the iPhone&#8230; that&#8217;s beauty and vitality and no&nbsp;openness.</p>
<p><img alt="Beauty, vitality, and openness" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/bvo.svg"></p>
<p>Well (as I hear voices clamouring that I&#8217;m being unfair to the iPhone),
I can&#8217;t create apps for the iPhone with Ubuntu. (You may be thinking
that I&#8217;m wrong, that I can make PhoneGap apps with build.phonegap.com,
or that I can do it some other way, and you&#8217;re as far as I can tell
incorrect, and I spent a long time looking into this. You need a
provisioning <span class="caps">ID</span>, and you can&#8217;t get one without a Mac. No, I&#8217;m not
interested in buying a Mac, nor am I interested in having a friend with
a Mac do the packaging for me.) My existing micro-<span class="caps">USB</span> chargers don&#8217;t
work and Apple adaptors cost fifteen quid each. I can&#8217;t sync with iTunes
because I don&#8217;t and won&#8217;t have iTunes. How can I even consider a phone
which doesn&#8217;t let me do this basic stuff without locking me in to
Apple&#8217;s ecosystem? What am I, some sort of&nbsp;traitor?</p>
<p>The three things I want: beauty, vitality, and openness. They&#8217;re <em>all</em>
important. Having a phone where I can&#8217;t make apps, where I can&#8217;t sync,
where it&#8217;s surreptitiously an upsell for the company&#8217;s laptops, is most
certainly a compromise of my ideals, and I&#8217;m not totally happy about it.
However, and this is the point, having a phone where I can&#8217;t do what I
want with it (the N9) or one where I find it unpleasant and unbeautiful
(Android) is <em>also</em> a compromise of my ideals, and I wasn&#8217;t happy about
that either. It might not be a compromise of your ideals &#8212; you&#8217;re not
expected to have the same goals as I do. You might not have those three
goals in balance: perhaps beauty&#8217;s more important to you, or perhaps
vitality is, or perhaps openness is. For me, they&#8217;re roughly in balance.
And no-one provides them all. So I&#8217;ve tried two sides of the
<em>beauty-vitality-openness</em> triangle; now I&#8217;m trying the third side. Nine
months ago I said that &#8220;<a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/04/my-new-phone-2012-edition">no-one can convincingly say that I will never,
ever, ever need iTunes</a>&#8220;, and &#8220;I’ll doubtless be looking
at a new phone again in a year; convince me then.&#8221;. Thanks to <a href="http://popey.com/">popey</a>
and <a href="http://paulhummer.org/">rockstar</a> I&#8217;m now reasonably convinced that I in fact do not need
iTunes to use an iPhone 5 with iOS 6. So far that&#8217;s been the case. I
cannot write apps, this is true, and that by itself might annoy me so
much over the next year that I get some other phone a year from now;
we&#8217;ll see. I can write web apps for the things I want, and maybe that&#8217;s
good enough. I don&#8217;t know. I certainly don&#8217;t need iTunes to sync: that&#8217;s
what Ubuntu One is for, and so far that&#8217;s working excellently: the first
three apps I installed were Ubuntu One Files, Ubuntu One Music, and
Bluefire, and now I can read all my ebooks on my phone and that&#8217;s about
40% of what I use it for taken care of right&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve got this iPhone. Niamh is properly annoyed that I have one and
she doesn&#8217;t, to which I say: unlucky, darling daughter. Wait a year and
you might inherit it when I move on&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8230; anyone have any recommendations for cool&nbsp;apps?</p>
