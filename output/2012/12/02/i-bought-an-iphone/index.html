</blockquote>
<p>So, I bought an iPhone.</p>
<p>Those of you who have known me for a while might be surprised by this.</p>
<p>My history with phones is long and detailed and very, very
idiosyncratic. I do not expect my reasons for wanting a thing to apply
to anyone else. Don't see this as a prescriptive essay telling you what
you should do, because it isn't. End of caveat.</p>
<p>After some considerable time using various phones I think I've defined
the criteria, the things I want from a phone, as three: <strong>beauty</strong>,
<strong>vitality</strong>, and <strong>openness</strong>. <strong>Beauty</strong> is about the software and the
hardware together: does the thing <em>feel</em> pleasurable to hold, to use, to
work with? <strong>Vitality</strong> is about the community: are there loads of apps?
Is there competition so individual apps get better? Do bugs get fixed?
When new things arrive, do they arrive on this platform? And
<strong>openness</strong> is about stuff that the platform <em>prevents</em> you from doing:
are there things that only certain magic anointed apps can do? Can I use
this device from Ubuntu? Can I build apps without buying the one
specific choice of IDE which doesn't work on my laptop? Are there things
which ought to work but don't because they compete with the platform
vendor's business model?</p>
<p>This, in the words of the old joke, is one of those "three things: you
can choose any two" situations.</p>
<p>Android, and Android phones, have vitality and openness, but not beauty.
(Idiosyncratic definition, remember. If you're just about to tell me
that you think the Nexus 4 is beautiful, I don't care; I don't think it
is. Disagreeing here is like telling someone you don't think their
husband is attractive; they're not interested in your opinion.) I find
Android to be inconsistent, incohesive, and annoying (with more detail
<a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/04/my-new-phone-2012-edition">9 months ago</a> if you want to read back). You are welcome to feel
differently; you probably don't share my taste in clothes either.
(Hardware beauty is achieved in Android phones solely in my opinion by
Sony with the Xperia range, but that doesn't help the software. And Sony
have a long-term record of unopenness, which is why I don't buy their
stuff.)</p>
<p>The Nokia N9... openness and beauty, no problem. I loved, and still
love, the N9 hardware, and I love the software too. Swiping to switch
between apps, that's great. Three home screens, great. The feed, great.
Applications that background explicitly rather than the phone thinking
it knows better than I do about when to kill an app, great. Accessories
that fit with the device and share design themes, great. But vitality is
not with the platform. It's decapitated upstream, and half the community
don't want to build great things on it; they want to build it itself. So
there are not many apps, and there's not much competition. So you don't
get Shazam. You don't get Google+. The web browser is mildly deficient
but more importantly isn't tested, so things like Grooveshark's HTML5
version don't work. There are great apps for N9 (most of which are
written by Thomas Perl ;)), and there's nothing <em>technical</em> which stops
it from being great. It just didn't take off. You can name reasons for
that until the cows come home -- it wasn't supported right by Nokia,
it's too difficult to write apps, it wasn't available in the right
countries, being open-source actually turns people off, the community
are too busy hacking the OS to build great things -- but the reason
doesn't matter. It didn't take off, and so the limitations I find in it
are very unlikely to be fixed.</p>
<p>And the iPhone... that's beauty and vitality and no openness.</p>
<p><img alt="Beauty, vitality, and openness" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/bvo.svg"></p>
<p>Well (as I hear voices clamouring that I'm being unfair to the iPhone),
I can't create apps for the iPhone with Ubuntu. (You may be thinking
that I'm wrong, that I can make PhoneGap apps with build.phonegap.com,
or that I can do it some other way, and you're as far as I can tell
incorrect, and I spent a long time looking into this. You need a
provisioning ID, and you can't get one without a Mac. No, I'm not
interested in buying a Mac, nor am I interested in having a friend with
a Mac do the packaging for me.) My existing micro-USB chargers don't
work and Apple adaptors cost fifteen quid each. I can't sync with iTunes
because I don't and won't have iTunes. How can I even consider a phone
which doesn't let me do this basic stuff without locking me in to
Apple's ecosystem? What am I, some sort of traitor?</p>
<p>The three things I want: beauty, vitality, and openness. They're <em>all</em>
important. Having a phone where I can't make apps, where I can't sync,
where it's surreptitiously an upsell for the company's laptops, is most
certainly a compromise of my ideals, and I'm not totally happy about it.
However, and this is the point, having a phone where I can't do what I
want with it (the N9) or one where I find it unpleasant and unbeautiful
(Android) is <em>also</em> a compromise of my ideals, and I wasn't happy about
that either. It might not be a compromise of your ideals -- you're not
expected to have the same goals as I do. You might not have those three
goals in balance: perhaps beauty's more important to you, or perhaps
vitality is, or perhaps openness is. For me, they're roughly in balance.
And no-one provides them all. So I've tried two sides of the
<em>beauty-vitality-openness</em> triangle; now I'm trying the third side. Nine
months ago I said that "<a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/04/my-new-phone-2012-edition">no-one can convincingly say that I will never,
ever, ever need iTunes</a>", and "I’ll doubtless be looking
at a new phone again in a year; convince me then.". Thanks to <a href="http://popey.com/">popey</a>
and <a href="http://paulhummer.org/">rockstar</a> I'm now reasonably convinced that I in fact do not need
iTunes to use an iPhone 5 with iOS 6. So far that's been the case. I
cannot write apps, this is true, and that by itself might annoy me so
much over the next year that I get some other phone a year from now;
we'll see. I can write web apps for the things I want, and maybe that's
good enough. I don't know. I certainly don't need iTunes to sync: that's
what Ubuntu One is for, and so far that's working excellently: the first
three apps I installed were Ubuntu One Files, Ubuntu One Music, and
Bluefire, and now I can read all my ebooks on my phone and that's about
40% of what I use it for taken care of right there.</p>
<p>So, I've got this iPhone. Niamh is properly annoyed that I have one and
she doesn't, to which I say: unlucky, darling daughter. Wait a year and
you might inherit it when I move on again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... anyone have any recommendations for cool apps?</p>
