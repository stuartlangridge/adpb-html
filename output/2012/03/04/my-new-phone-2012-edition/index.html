		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>For some time now I've been growing increasingly dissatisfied with my
Nexus S. Those of you who follow me on <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/+">Google+</a> may have seen a
number of discussions on this point. So I was thinking about a new
phone, and here I'll lay out my thoughts.</p>
<p>Warning: this will be long.</p>
<p>Obviously the choice is between iPhone and Android. Now, I've been an
Android user for some years now; started with the HTC Hero, then a
Google Nexus One, then (when I fell over while ~~I was drunk~~it was icy
on Christmas Eve), a Google Nexus S. My desire for the Nexus line was
because I don't particularly like the "added value" that Android vendors
add to their phones, and because Nexus phones, because they're from
Google themselves, are designed to exhibit the latest cool stuff in a
given Android release and therefore <em>get</em> that Android release before
other stuff.</p>
<p>So, iPhone or Android? Android or iPhone? Much thought went into this
process.</p>
<p>And then I bought a Nokia N9, which runs <em>Meego</em> of all things, a mobile
OS which is neither iOS nor Android.</p>
<p>Herewith, a conversation between me and interlocutors both real and
imaginary to try and answer a bunch of questions about my mobile phone
choices. I should note up front (and this is important): I am not trying
to convince anyone else of anything here. This is what I think, and why.
If you read this as me telling you that your choices for yourself are
wrong, then you're misreading it. But feel free to read it as me telling
you why your choices for <em>me</em> are wrong, and then feel free to disagree
if you want.</p>
<p><strong>You did what? What the hell is an "N9"?</strong></p>
<p>Before Nokia got into bed with Windows Phone 7, and believing that
Symbian wasn't really up to the challenge of modern smartphones, they
made their own mobile phone touchscreen OS, called Maemo. Then they
partnered with Intel and turned that into "Meego". <em>Then</em>, both
companies dropped the project, pretty much; Nokia went into Windows
Phone, and Intel are doing something called Tizen. But in that brief
interregnum Nokia released a phone called the N9, which ran this Meego
thing (and a phone called the N950, which was an N9 with a hardware
keyboard and was aimed at developers).</p>
<p>The phone itself is beautiful, too. It feels the right weight in my
hand, it's blue rather than boring black, the screen's precise and
sharp, and it doesn't have old-Android-esque hardware buttons because it
doesn't need them. Like it, a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Why get some obscure phone, though? The market is all Android and
iOS.</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, it turns out that I don't really care about the market,
here, because where the market is means two things: further development
of the OS, and quantity of apps available for the phone. And I just
don't use that many apps. I've had a smartphone probably as long as you
have, gentle reader, and I was trying to batter previous phones into
being smart-ish enough to let me read books and see the web before that.
I don't say this to somehow push geekier-than-thou credentials, but to
show that I have a number of years of my own smartphone usage to
analyse. And that has shown me that I primarily use the following
things, in roughly descending order of usage: a web browser, Twitter, an
epub reader, email, an audiobook reader, a music player, a calendar,
wakeup alarms, a camera, Google+, Foursquare, Google Reader, a remote
for my bedroom media TV, Youtube, SMS messaging, Shazam, and a couple of
little games to while away spare minutes when I don't fancy reading. And
that's, basically, it. I had tens of apps installed on my Nexus S and
they just didn't get used.</p>
<p>And, importantly, every phone in the world either has those things as
native apps or, tantalisingly, they're available as web apps. I did a
talk a couple of weeks ago at a Multipack Presents session in Birmingham
where I exhorted mobile app developers to consider building web apps
when they can, instead of leaping for a native app and limiting
themselves to one platform, and this was a chance to try practising what
I had preached.</p>
<p><strong>Web apps? They just aren't as good as native apps, man.</strong></p>
<p>That's part of what I'm investigating, here. I'm using the web for, from
the above list, the web browser (obviously), Twitter, email, Google+,
Foursquare, Google Reader, my XBMC remote, and YouTube. I'll also be
using it, soon, as my music player and audiobook reader and epub reader,
but I need to write those first ;-)</p>
<p>Part of the reason I'm trying to use web apps for this stuff is exactly
to discover what the limitations are. One pretty big one is: a web app
can't do things while it isn't running. Another one, which has become
pretty clear to me over the last week, is that Android's support for
using a web app like a real app is really annoying; "installing" a
webapp by bookmarking it to your home screen is irritating, and Android
has a bad habit of just opening that bookmark like a web page in the
browser, not like a separate app. Finally, while the promise of the web
is that it can talk to native things and work with non-web stuff, that's
not really there yet; it'd be impossible to implement Shazam on the web,
without Flash, right now, although it's getting there. The Nokia
"Browser 8.5" is excellent; it appears to be pretty much just as
up-to-date with supporting modern web stuff as Android or iOS, it's
webkit-based, and even if it wasn't there's a preliminary build of Opera
Mobile, so that's all OK.</p>
<p>But, in general, I'm finding the experience of using web apps only a
little behind the native experience <em>for well-written careful native
apps</em>, and as far as I can see, a lot of that delta is because we just
don't have as much experience writing apps which work brilliantly in a
mobile browser; we're still working it out. So I'm happy using the web.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you not using an iPhone? Everyone except geeks has an iPhone</strong></p>
<p>Main reason is this: no-one can convincingly say that I will never,
ever, ever need iTunes. Recent versions of iOS are much better in this
regard -- updates are over-the-air now, for example, and initial
registration doesn't need iTunes any more -- but when I asked questions
like "what if my iPhone breaks? Do I have to plug it in and do an iTunes
thing? What if I take it into the Apple store and tell them I don't have
iTunes?" I didn't get very convincing "no, you will never need iTunes"
answers. Maybe it really is true that I don't need it and I just didn't
hear from the right people; maybe it isn't quite true yet but will be in
iOS 6. I'll doubtless be looking at a new phone again in a year;
convince me then.</p>
<p>Small side issue: as far as I can tell, it is not possible for me to
make apps for iOS without a Mac. Not even PhoneGap apps.</p>
<p><strong>You can have iTunes; just dual-boot into Windows or buy a Mac and run
OS X and then run Ubuntu in a virtual machine</strong></p>
<p>No thanks. I'm an Ubuntu user. Not interested in running anything else.
I have noticed that a fair few Ubuntu users who also have iPhones aren't
really Ubuntu users; they're OS X users who also run Ubuntu sometimes.
That isn't me.</p>
<p><strong>You don't need iTunes; just download libiphoneconnectorframework from
github and then gtk-make-my-iphone-work from this Sourceforge site and
then compile this kernel module to connect and...</strong></p>
<p>No thanks. I'm sure that it probably is possible to have a totally
iTunes-less life of iOS with entirely open-source stuff, and I
completely respect the people working on that, but I'm just not
interested in fighting to make my hardware work. My days of doing that
are past. It's not you, it's me.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you not using Android? ICS 4.0 is great!</strong></p>
<p>I didn't like ICS. My Nexus S has not yet had an official rollout of
Android 4.0, which is annoying in itself, by the way; it's only a year
old! It's the next-most-recent Nexus model! It's officially
Google-branded! Why can't it run the latest Android OS! Grr! But
ignoring that, there was an unofficial build, which was the official
build until it turned out that there were battery life problems with it.
So I installed that. Now, I had battery life problems, indeed (serious
ones; I'd walk out the door with my phone fully charged at 7pm and sit
in the pub drinking and playing on Twitter and the phone would be dead
by midnight, which is unacceptable), but I've been convinced that they
are a bug and not a fundamental problem. My fundamental problem with
Android, now, is this: I don't like the direction it's going, and I
found ICS uninspiring and disparate and bitty and
incohesive<span style="color:red" title="not necessarily a word">*</span>.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean, incohesive? ICS has had a full makeover!</strong></p>
<p>No it hasn't, and that's the point. There are some nicer design elements
in Android 4.0, but they only show up in some places. Most apps don't
use them. It's still totally unclear what the back button will do in an
app. Some apps have ICSed themselves and therefore don't use the
hardware buttons any more; others have not yet made the move; others
still seem to try to detect whether I have hardware buttons and use them
if so. I am sure it is possible to make a beautifully consistent set of
applications for Android, but it just hasn't happened; Android has the
same problem that Linux always had, that for a long time there was no
strong design lead-by-example, and now that there <em>is</em> you still have
large portions of the Android community who don't like it, don't want to
fit in with it, and consider that a virtue. Perhaps it is a virtue, but
not for me. The much vaunted Android "fragmentation" makes this a little
more difficult; it <em>is</em> harder to write an Android app when you have to
do extra work to design Back functions into your UI if there's no
hardware button, and not if there is, but I don't think fragmentation of
hardware is the real issue; fragmentation of design aesthetic is the
problem, and there is very little indication that the Android app dev
community want to fix that, even if Google's design team do. Again, you
may consider this a feature rather than a bug, and that's fine; I do
not.</p>
<p><strong>But Android is Linux! It's the great hope for open source! You should
use it!</strong></p>
<p>My N9's Linux, too. And it's a lot more similar to my Ubuntu machine
than Android is. Apps use D-Bus, they can be written in Python if you
want, the widget set is Qt, etc, etc. Lots of open-source-desktop stuff
in there.</p>
<p><strong>Oh so you're using this Meego thing because you're a freetard?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. I looked at the phones available to me, and the N9 came up on top,
for reasons that this exceptionally long set of Q&amp;As attempt to outline.
That the system is, under the covers, pretty similar to my Ubuntu
machine was a factor, but a relatively small one; what I found most
compelling about that was that I was pretty confident that it'd <em>work</em>
with Ubuntu without problems, which has indeed turned out to be the
case. That it's "Linux" qua Linux didn't really enter into it.</p>
<p><strong>Meego's abandonware and unmaintained. Why are you tying yourself to a
dying or already dead OS?</strong></p>
<p>Now, that's an interesting point. There seems to be a fairly vibrant,
although small, developer community, and there seems to be a group at
Nokia still working on this; a few days ago I received, OTA, the latest
new version of Meego. It's also excellently documented; the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120304133100/http://www.developer.nokia.com/Resources/Library/Web/nokia-browsers/nokia-browser-85-for-meego-12-harmattan.html">web apps
documentation</a> in particular was a hugely motivating factor in
convincing me before purchase that the N9 would do what I want.</p>
<p><strong>That's not what I meant. It's basically maintained by the community.
That's no good.</strong></p>
<p>So is Android, dude. Like I said above, there is no official Android 4.0
for my Nexus S, the flagship Google phone until about three months ago.
Let alone my daughter's LG Optimus One, which still has Android 2.2 (or
possibly even 2.1, I'm not sure) and no sign whatsoever of getting an
upgrade. I used to be relatively confident that sticking with the Nexus
line would get me the new shiny, and now I am not; the Nexus One doesn't
have ICS, the Nexus S doesn't have ICS, which means buying a brand new
Galaxy Nexus to get it... and presumably buying a Nexus Next Generation
a year from now to get Android 5.0 Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Yes, I can use a custom ROM; I can install Cyanogen and get updated
Android versions, I can download one of a zillion ports from XDA. But
then... that's a community maintained version of the OS, no? Just like
Meego is.</p>
<p><strong>I need Android because I'm tightly wedded to the Google ecosystem.
Aren't you?</strong></p>
<p>Well, my N9 is perfectly happily using mail, calendars, contacts, RSS
reading, and Plus from Google. What else does it need? It's a little
easier to set up on Android, I'll certainly admit that -- sign in once,
and everything works, and that's lovely -- but it wasn't hard on the N9
either.</p>
<p><strong>It's <em>not</em> just iPhone and Android. Why aren't you using WebOS/Windows
Phone 7/Blackberry/Boot2Gecko/Symbian/something?</strong></p>
<p><em>~~Palm~~HP webOS</em>: I like webOS a lot, but you cannot buy it on a phone
without a hardware keyboard. I hate hardware keyboards. Sorry.</p>
<p><em>Blackberry</em>: Hardware keyboard, again. I also didn't investigate
Blackberry all that hard; there is an idea in my head that there is a
Blackberry without keyboard and with a modern browser, and that would
have been an alternative. Let me know if there is.</p>
<p><em>Windows Phone 7</em>: I like Windows Phone 7 a great, great deal, and I
came very close to buying a phone with it on. One of the things I really
like about it, like webOS, is that it's not just an iOS copy like I
think Android largely is; they sat down and thought about a new and
interesting way to work with a phone, and they did in my opinion a
damned good job. I find WP7 easy to use and beautiful, and I was very
tempted. But... it does not work well with Ubuntu. You can't even plug
it in to an Ubuntu laptop and copy files onto the phone; it doesn't use
MTP (which everyone knows how to talk, even if imperfectly) but some
weird undocumented Microsoft extension called "mtp-z" which we have no
idea how to use, and some bloke is having to reverse-engineer on github.
Of course there is a Windows driver, and there's a "Mac connector", but
nothing for Ubuntu. It's also, like the iPhone, as far as I can tell
impossible to build apps (even PhoneGap apps) for it without a Windows
machine. So, no. I tried talking to an MS guy about this at CES, and he
was all "no we do Windows and the Mac and that's it, so you're out of
luck, goodbye". So, goodbye, Windows Phone. For extra credit, the best
WP7 phone on the market right now is the Nokia Lumia 800, which is... my
N9 with Windows hardware buttons on it.</p>
<p><em>Symbian</em>: it can, in theory, do everything I want; I had a Nokia E50
before I went Android. But it's in my opinion just not up to the
challenge of running a slick touchscreen experience.</p>
<p><em>Ubuntu Phone</em>: doesn't exist yet.</p>
<p><em>Boot2Gecko</em>: does not exist as a phone I can buy, yet. Ignoring that
I'm a bit disappointed that the UI is just an Android copy, for now,
maybe I'll get a B2G phone in a year when the phone exists. I like the
mentality underlying it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>OK, so I can see how you, Stuart, find the N9 a good fit for what you
want. So, what's wrong with it?</strong></p>
<p>Well... here's a list of things I've found to be less than perfect in my
first two weeks of use. Here's hoping the software ones, at least, get
fixed.</p>
<p>It doesn't do HTML5 audio. Or, rather, now that I have had the latest
version of Meego sent to me OTA, it sort of does; an audio element
becomes a button which you can press, and which opens up a full-screen
audio player rather like the full-screen video player. Which is of
course sod all use if you're trying to build an HTML-based audio player
or audiobook player. Grr.</p>
<p>The text selection stuff is not great. Weirdly, it seems like bits of
the N9 know how to do this right; you get a little magnifying glass
showing where your finger is, and you can move the cursor perfectly, but
<em>most text fields don't do this</em>. WTF, Nokia?</p>
<p>No Shazam. :(</p>
<p>No PhoneGap port, yet, although a bloke is working on it, hooray!</p>
<p>The outside buttons (power, volume) feel a tiny bit more flimsy than
they should.</p>
<p>It's a sealed unit, so I can't put in a new battery. Honestly, this
doesn't actually bother me, but maybe it will in the future. Gonna get
one of those in-the-pocket charging thingies, so that'll alleviate that
problem. Recommendations for good ones are invited.</p>
<p>No Ubuntu One port, yet, so I'm using the website. I shall be fixing
this (see complaints about HTML5 audio and no PhoneGap port for why I
have not already done so; I'm working on it. :))</p>
<p><strong>You didn't answer <em>my</em> question...</strong></p>
<p>Go ahead and ask it. I'll try.</p>
