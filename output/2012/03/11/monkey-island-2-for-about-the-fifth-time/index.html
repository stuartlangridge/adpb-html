			<p>My dining table has four&nbsp;legs.</p>
<p>Now, you, you sad, hidebound slave to convention, might not think of
that as particularly unusual, and to be honest I don&#8217;t either, but for a
brief moment last week it had three legs because one of them fell off.
While I was sitting at it. So, after what was frankly a superhuman feat
of contortionism by yr. hmbl. crspndnt. stopping it from collapsing
while holding my laptop in one hand and a jar of pens to boot, I
frustratedly pushed it against a wall upside-down and resolved to buy a
new one. This weekend I mentioned said shopping trip to Niamh, my
daughter, who was already taking me out in order that I might have the
privilege of buying her her first pair of ballet pointe&nbsp;shoes.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Can we not just put a screw in it?&#8221;, asked Darling Daughter, who is, I
have to in fairness point out, even more ham-fisted with <span class="caps">DIY</span> than I&nbsp;am.</p>
<p>I demurred, but after a mild amount of badgering consented to try out
this feat of construction on a par with the building of the Pyramids,
and, lo, we managed it. My table hath once more four legs (Jeremiah, ch.
2 v. 11). And so, feeling somewhat like Cortez on his peak in Darien if
Cortez had just got his Junior Screwdriver Usage badge, we set out, and
returned a few hours later, having spent less money than I expected on
shoes and still enjoying the traces of a superb Chinese lunch in
Cosmo&#8217;s, Wolverhampton. All was well with the world. This is a strange
and unusual&nbsp;feeling.</p>
<p>To reward ourselves for this hitherto unprecedented experience of
shopping and <span class="caps">DIY</span> success, Niamh and I have been playing Monkey Island&nbsp;2.</p>
<p>Now, I played <span class="caps">MI2</span> (and the original Monkey Island) the first time around
in the early nineties when they were released, of course. My ex and I
went through a stage of playing adventure games in the late nineties,
too — it was jolly good fun, and also a jolly cheap way to spend a
weekend, back when there was no money — and I&#8217;ve gone through all the
LucasArts games at one time or another. (I was never a Myst person;
third-person LucasArts-style games for me, always — Loom, <span class="caps">MI1</span> and 2,
Toonstruck, Gabriel&nbsp;Knight.)</p>
<p>This weekend, Niamh and I were poking around the PlayStation Store, and
there was <em>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#8217;s Revenge: Special Edition, Trial
Version</em>, and I said to Niamh: here, see what you think of this. Played
the trial (which is the first couple of scenes of Act 1), she liked it,
I forked over eight quid, and we had the full version, and settled in to&nbsp;play.</p>
<p>I should note that this is about the fifth time that LucasArts have made
me pay money for this game. I believe I deserve some kind of award, or
perhaps a money-off voucher, or maybe at a push the chance to give Ron
Gilbert a Chinese burn or something, not that I&#8217;d do that because I&#8217;d be
too busy trying to work out which bit of him made him good at his job so
I could cut it off and brew it into a serum I could inject into my
living&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p>Anyway, we played. Lasted the whole of Saturday afternoon and the whole
of Sunday, and we completed the game with half an hour to spare before
we had to stop. And eight pounds is, frankly, pretty good value for that
much entertainment, especially given a world where a cinema ticket costs
nearly that much and at no point during our game did I stick to the
floor or have to pay thirteen pounds for a bag of popcorn which is
mostly air with butterscotch on it. So I don&#8217;t resent having to buy the
game <em>again</em>. Well, not&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>Residual bitterness excised, Niamh went home and I settled down to think
about the experience. Because… I didn&#8217;t like the game as much as I
thought I&nbsp;would.</p>
<p>There is a standard complaint about LucasArts-style third-person
graphical adventures. It is this: you need a fish. So you go to the fish
shop, and the guy in the fish shop says, I&#8217;ll give you a fish if you
retrieve my lost silver tankard from the bottom of the well. So you go
to the well, and the bucket&#8217;s broken, and you talk to Liza who owns the
bucket and she&#8217;ll fix it if you&#8217;ll get her a hammer and nails, but the
woodsmith won&#8217;t give you the hammer until you get him a sandwich, and
the sandwich shop only trades sandwiches for plastic Christmas
ornaments, and you can&#8217;t get a plastic Christmas ornament until you&#8217;ve
dressed up as a fairy, and the fairy costume has a hole in it, and you
can&#8217;t patch the hole until the seamstress&#8217;s cat is down from the tree,&nbsp;and…</p>
<p>This is not my complaint. I do not mind this. Sure, it&#8217;s a bit
exasperating at times, but I&#8217;m fine with it. No, my sources of
disappointment are two-fold, and they are these: graphics, and
arbitrariness. Thus, into&nbsp;subheadings:</p>
<h3>Arbitrariness</h3>
<p>Some people might see the whole fish-tankard-bucket palaver above as
arbitrary, and it is. However, it&#8217;s clear what to do. The fish shop guy
tells you: I need my silver tankard, and you know that you have to get a
silver tankard. That&#8217;s arbitrary but it&#8217;s clear, and it&#8217;s sometimes
amusing in a wry exasperating sort of way, rather like an annoying but
cute nephew, or blog comments about Ubuntu. No, the arbitrariness is
where the fish shop guy tells you that he can&#8217;t give you a fish because
he&#8217;s unhappy, and it turns out that to make him happy you need to give
him a painting of a comet, or a green amulet, or four plates of
spaghetti carbonara. Perhaps there are people in the world who discover
the weird obscure clue you&#8217;d need to recognise this, or perhaps I&#8217;m just
not in tune enough with the Zen of the universe to correctly identify
these things, but I do believe that I solve these problems the same way
everyone else in an adventure game solves them: try giving everything in
your inventory to the guy, and then roll your eyes at the cooked-up
post-giving rationalisation as to why it&nbsp;worked.</p>
<p>What this means is, as notably observed by Zarf in a few other game
reviews, that the game is barely interactive. There&#8217;s cleverness
involved in discovering in the guy&#8217;s diary that he likes pink things,
and therefore resolving to bring him something pink to make him happy,
and settling on blancmange because it&#8217;s the only pink thing in the game.
There is no cleverness involved in trekking around the map picking up
everything that isn&#8217;t nailed down and then mechanically offering every
item to every badly-worded repetitive <span class="caps">NPC</span> in the hope that one of them
turns out to like the blancmange and so give you a typewriter. It&#8217;s
pointless and irritating and it gets old very, very&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I don&#8217;t remember being this annoyed with the arbitrary
nature of the thing during the last eighteen times I played it. Maybe I
got old very quickly. My oldness is also somewhat exposed by how I found
myself thinking that Guybrush is a really mean dick during this. Even
ignoring the whole &#8220;steal everything without compunction&#8221; nature of the
game, because the convention is literally that you can take anything
that you want, he spends his whole time tricking and breaking stuff that
would have probably been fine were he to just ask. I mean, he needs a
crypt key, so to get it he doesn&#8217;t ask Stan; he doesn&#8217;t even trick Stan
out of the room and pinch it while his back&#8217;s turned (although he does
that to about fifteen other people). No, our hero watches Stan climb
into a coffin and then <em>nails it shut with Stan inside it</em>. Ron. Really.
We need to&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p>That was made even more interesting by how Niamh didn&#8217;t want to do it,
even after we looked at a walkthrough to work out how to keep Stan in
there for a few seconds longer (we&#8217;d tried putting heavy stuff on the
coffin temporarily), partially because it&#8217;s just bloody horrid and
partially because Stan would obviously be apocalyptically cross with us
about it. I found myself having to explain that, no, this sort of
thing&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> in games, while not believing a word of it. I felt like a&nbsp;murderer.</p>
<p>The really annoying arbitrary thing, though, is not the random stuff
that you&#8217;d never think to do without the walkthrough (put the banana on
the metronome so that it hypnotises a monkey (really, Ron?) so that the
monkey stiffens up to the point where you can use him as a spanner
(<span class="caps">REALLY</span>, Ron?)). It&#8217;s where it&#8217;s perfectly obvious what the puzzle is,
it&#8217;s perfectly obvious how to solve it, and you&#8217;ve got twelve possible
inventory items that <em>could</em> do the thing you want and <em>only one of them
works</em>. A spade is <em>not</em> just a tool for digging and nothing else. If I
come across a bag hanging from a tree that I can&#8217;t quite reach then
fine, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span> with being able to slash the bag open with the broken
bottle, but if I were there in the real world then I&#8217;d just lamp the bag
with the spade until it fell down, and that&#8217;s <em>just as reasonable a
solution</em>. This exposes the unthought, unimaginative, one-key-one-lock
nature of the game&#8217;s puzzles more sharply than anything I can possibly
imagine, and the worst thing about it is that it&#8217;s both fixable and
unfixed. The whole banana-on-the-metronome thing is creative, at the
least, and you can see why it worked afterwards even if not before, but
there is <em>nothing stopping</em> the developers offering multiple solutions
to a puzzle. If after I&#8217;ve solved a thing I find myself saying, sure,
but I <em>still</em> don&#8217;t know why I couldn&#8217;t just hit the bag with the spade,
then playtesting should bring that out and you should bloody well
implement both, game devs. I&#8217;m not talking about major branches in the
world tree here; simple solutions to simple one-room puzzles which would
have no effect on the flow of the game and would therefore not peel back
the lovely frontispiece to show the ugly grinding machinery beneath.
Monkey Island gets a tiny, tiny pass on this as it&#8217;s possible that they
wanted to implement both of these and didn&#8217;t because they couldn&#8217;t fit
the &#8220;bag and spade&#8221; animation on the floppy disk that the original game
came on. But only a <em>tiny</em>&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to overuse italics, which is always a sign of encroaching
annoyance, so instead of being angry I&#8217;ll be wistful and moan about&nbsp;the</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like the&nbsp;graphics.</p>
<p>A bit of explanation is in order here. The game we played on the
PlayStation is a &#8220;Special Edition&#8221;, where all the graphics have been
redrawn to look nicer, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2:_LeChuck%27s_Revenge#Special_Edition">indeed they are nicer</a>. Niamh
inadvertently switched the game into original-graphics mode at one point
and thought she&#8217;d broken it. But I think something ineffable has been
lost. I really didn&#8217;t like the sequel games (Curse of Monkey Island,
Escape from Monkey Island, the recent Tales of Monkey Island series),
and a lot of that is down to (in a memorable phrasing) &#8220;<a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/gamerev/longestjourney.html">a terrible
fetid air of jokes run into the ground</a>&#8220;, but it&#8217;s also that the
graphics aren&#8217;t right. This isn&#8217;t an Uncanny Valley problem — the later
games, at least some of them, are cartoons, not an attempt to model real
people — it&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re <em>not right</em>, for reasons I find
difficult to&nbsp;explain.</p>
<p>The best example of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_%28Monkey_Island%29#Stan">Stan</a>. Stan, the distilled essence of all
incredibly-annoying car salesmen in one overly-hatted being, has a
jacket with a stationary pattern on it. Now, I don&#8217;t mean here that the
pattern on it isn&#8217;t animated; I mean, it is stationary. Completely. It&#8217;s
like his jacket is actually a jacket-shaped hole into a universe made
entirely of plaid. Every time I see it it makes me laugh. (See the
picture on the above-linked Wikipedia article if you&#8217;re not sure what
I&#8217;m talking about.) The game developers recognised that this made me
laugh (how decent of them!) and kept it for later games. But it&#8217;s just
<em>not funny</em> in a game with better graphics. Stan himself, with his
wildly waving arms, isn&#8217;t funny when he&#8217;s Gouraud-shaded and ray-traced
and accurate and has more than 114 pixels to play&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Some of you might be thinking, huh, what is he like? Graphics has moved
on, man, stop pining for the <span class="caps">EGA</span> displays of your youth when men were
men and you could only have two colours in a character box. This is an
unfair accusation, and I refute it thus: I did not like the graphics in
Day of the Tentacle either, and they were just as crap. There&#8217;s
something about Monkey Island specifically, about the economy of line,
about the sheer expressiveness that those designers of twenty years ago
managed to get out of a character a hundred pixels tall, that is just
lost never to return when you get <span class="caps">512MB</span> of graphics memory to do it in.
<span class="caps">DOTT</span> was and is a fine game, for sure, but there&#8217;s no character in it
that made me laugh just to look at him like Stan did. Elaine is much
less attractive now she&#8217;s fully-realised graphically, I&nbsp;think.  </p>
<h3>So, well, y&#8217;know, so&nbsp;what?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;d still recommend it. If you haven&#8217;t played Monkey Islands 1 and 2, go
get them. You can play them on damned nearly any computing device
imaginable, thanks to the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> people, and the game&#8217;s really
cheap. Niamh loved it, even if I did have to explain why &#8220;I&#8217;m selling
these fine leather jackets&#8221; is funny. I recommend the first two <span class="caps">MI</span> games
to anyone who hasn&#8217;t played&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t get the others. And remember to put the banana on the&nbsp;metronome.</p>
