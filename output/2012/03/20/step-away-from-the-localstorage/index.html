		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>There has been much discussion (<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/there-is-no-simple-solution-for-local-storage/">example</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2012/02/22/psa-dom-local-storage-considered-harmful/">example</a>, <a href="http://webreflection.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/whats-localstorage-about.html">example</a>,
<a href="http://paul.kinlan.me/we-need-to-kill-off-the-localstorage-api/">example</a>) recently about how the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage">in-browser localStorage API</a> is
terrible and must be killed with fire.</p>
<p>My first reaction here is <a href="http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/health/leave-bacon-out-of-it,-health-experts-warned-20071031506/">step away from the bacon, son, leave the
bacon out of this</a>. The localStorage API seems to have a few quoted
problems, the main ones being that it's synchronous, it does file IO,
and it's got bad event support. Put against that, rather snidely it
seems, is the benefit that "it's easy to use".</p>
<p>Did I miss a meeting? Is being easy to use suddenly a bad thing? Isn't
that one of the major benefits of using Apple stuff, that it makes sense
and people can get it without a PhD in computer science? Or does that
only apply to <em>users</em>, who are presumably too busy on the sofa with a
bag of Cheetos, and not to <em>developers</em>, who are meant to do things the
hard way whenever possible?</p>
<p>Doing file IO and having bad event support are, certainly, issues with
localStorage if you're trying to use it for any kind of really serious
data storage. If you're Gmail, maybe you want something better. But you
know what? Most of the things I build aren't Gmail, and most of the
things you build aren't either. I don't need event support for
localStorage; I just want to stash a value in it and then move on.
That's all. Doing file IO… well, any storage mechanism had better be
doing file IO at <em>some</em> point so that my data gets saved to disc!</p>
<p>Ah, no, say the detractors, but it's <em>synchronous</em>. That's bad: it
blocks. This seems to boil down to two problems: it might block my tab,
and it might block other people's tabs. Now, that's an issue, right
enough. However, blocking my tab is something that I can think about and
decide whether I'm prepared to run the risk or not. Because what you're
asking for is that I replace this:</p>
<p><code>localStorage.setItem("key", "value");</code></p>
<p>with this</p>

<p>and you know what? Given that choice… I believe I might at least
sometimes choose that blocking my tab for a microsecond and very
occasionally blocking my tab for two whole seconds is actually OK. I'm
allowed! It's my tab!</p>
<p>Fine, I'm being a bit facetious. There are problems with localStorage,
and it would be good to see them resolved. But there are alternatives
other than "you must ditch it and use IndexedDB, Mr Developer", I think.
What would be wrong with providing an asynchronous variant of
localStorage, so I do
<code>localStorage.setItemAsync("key", "value", function() { carryon... })</code>?
Mozilla say "Implement localStorage in an asynchronous fashion in
browsers – actively disregarding the spec? (this could set a dangerous
precedent though)", as if the idea of the browser manufacturers working
together to adjust the spec is just impossible; did I miss something
there? The spec process is open to stuff being adjusted or added to;
that's the point of it, right? And localStorage use in my tab blocking
other people's tabs… I can't think of a nice way of saying "that's a
browser issue", but it is. I feel sad having to say that, because I know
that the engineers at Mozilla and other places have done superhuman work
in this area and will continue to do so, but really one tab blocking
causing others to block is surely something which is a problem for more
than just localStorage?</p>
<p>There are problems with localStorage. Real ones. But I think that those
calling for its complete removal are vastly underestimating the
attractiveness of an API that's easy to use, and also vastly
underestimating how annoying it is to be forced to use something way
more complicated because it copes better with pathological cases. I'd
love to hear more argument on this subject, but I don't want it to look
like there's a consensus around "it must go". Someone needs to speak up
for developers who just wanna get stuff done, like me...</p>
