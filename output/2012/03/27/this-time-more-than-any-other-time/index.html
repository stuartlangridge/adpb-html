<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Here lies Edmund Blackadder. And he&#8217;s bloody&nbsp;annoyed.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tonight I went to see my daughter dance in a show. Also there with me
was my ex-wife&#8217;s mother, and the chap she married a couple of months
ago. So I suppose that would make him my future-step-ex-father-in-law.
For simplicity we&#8217;ll call him Rowland. Anyway, I wanted to video a
particular bit of the show (a bit with Niamh in, obviously) but couldn&#8217;t
since I was a row or two back, so Rowland did it on his phone. During
the interval I said: I&#8217;d like that video, and I know
Sam<span style="color:red" title="ex-wife">*</span> would too because
that particular bit wasn&#8217;t in last night&#8217;s show, which <em>she</em> saw. And
Rowland said: <span class="caps">OK</span>, how do I get it to&nbsp;you?</p>
<p>Now, this is a modern flagship smartphone he&#8217;s holding in his hand, not
some ancient Sagem thing with buttons. So I said: just email it to me.
How do I do that? he says, and hands me the phone. It turns out that
he&#8217;s got this phone in order that he can get the football results on it,
and to send text messages. Never set up an email account: didn&#8217;t even
know you <em>could</em> read email on phones. He&#8217;s a smart guy; just doesn&#8217;t
care about the technology, and who can blame him? Still, <span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;ve got a
video on this phone, and I want to get it to me, somehow. We&#8217;ve got good
internet coverage. So, how do I do it? Guess&nbsp;away!</p>
<p><strong>email it to my own email address</strong>: can&#8217;t do that, because he hasn&#8217;t
set up his email account, and I can&#8217;t ask him to do so because we&#8217;re
sitting in the audience of a show and he doesn&#8217;t know how&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p><strong>text it to my phone</strong>: nope, video&#8217;s too big (<span class="caps">40MB</span> or&nbsp;so)</p>
<p><strong>upload it to my Ubuntu One account</strong>: before we start here, this is
his phone, so I was understandably wary of signing into any of <em>my</em>
accounts on it, but since he doesn&#8217;t have any of his own accounts set
up, perhaps I have no choice. So, reluctantly, I sign into Ubuntu One as
myself and try uploading… and the browser crashes. Try it again, crashes
again. Hm, thinks I, sounds like we&#8217;ve got a bug there. Sign out of U1.
What else can I&nbsp;try?</p>
<p><strong>Use some temporary file upload service</strong>: ok. How does one find one of
these which isn&#8217;t just for warez and porn and hooky videos? (You may
have noticed that I am <em>living</em> <a href="http://xkcd.com/949/">xkcd.com/949/</a> at this point.) Bit of
Googling, and I found one which looked sensible (note: the key trigger
word, at least at this point in time, is &#8220;html5&#8221;; it may get you a bunch
of hot air and bullshit from industry analysts, but if a site mentions
it then it&#8217;s probably relatively modern, at least.) Try uploading (I
can&#8217;t remember which one I found), and… browser crashes. So it&#8217;s not an
Ubuntu One problem (phew!), it&#8217;s just with file uploading from this
browser. Bloody fantastic. What else can I&nbsp;do?</p>
<p><strong>bluetooth it to <em>my</em> phone</strong>: tried that, and my phone rejected it but
I don&#8217;t know why. Can you send <span class="caps">40MB</span> files over Bluetooth? Maybe this is
a fault in my phone. Don&#8217;t know. Didn&#8217;t work. Next&nbsp;attempt.</p>
<p><strong>sign in to my email account and send it to myself</strong>: <span class="caps">OK</span>. There are
three email clients on this phone (three email clients for fuck&#8217;s
fucking sake!?‽). One of them is a gmail app. I am scared of signing
into my gmail account in an official gmail app in case the phone Learns
My Account and I can&#8217;t remove it easily. Second email app says &#8220;Your
trial has expired. Please renew your subscription&#8221; (honestly? Trialware
on a <em>phone</em>? What kind of shitty world do we live in where this is a
good idea??). Third email app, I create a new email account which is my
gmail account (with fear and trepidation), and try sending an email to
myself with the video attached. &#8220;Email sending…&#8221;, it says, followed by…
nothing. No indication that it had worked or had not, except that I had
no email (and that there was no way that <span class="caps">40MB</span> had uploaded that fast).
Tried it twice; same thing. Delete my email account from crappy email
client.&nbsp;Next.</p>
<p><strong>sign into my gmail account in official gmail app</strong>: fearful plan,
this. Fortunately, it failed early enough that I didn&#8217;t have to try;
attempting it gives &#8220;file too big to attach&#8221;. Thanks a fucking bundle,
gmail. Oh no wait, no thanks at all. Try something&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Now somewhat desperate. There is a &#8220;flickr&#8221; app here. Maybe I can upload
the video to my flickr account? Flickr does videos now, I think. Sign in
to flickr app with ancient Yahoo <span class="caps">ID</span>, video starts uploading! yay!
<span class="caps">FIFTEEN</span> <span class="caps">MINUTES</span> later it gets to 100%, and&#8230; then just sits there at
100% without completing. And then it goes back to zero and starts again.
It gets to 65% done a second time and then the show ended. Since my only
two options were to go home or to throw Rowland&#8217;s phone into a volcano
and <em>then</em> go home, I gave him back his phone and went&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>We have failed as an&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>Now, there are those of you reading this and thinking: that wouldn&#8217;t
have happened if he&#8217;d have had <em>this phone</em> or <em>this app</em> or <em>this
software</em> or <em>this service</em>. Stop thinking that. This is a guy not
interested in technology who bought a flagship internet device and has
been appallingly let down by that. How will he be helped by you sneering
and using his failure as an excuse to score political points? We&#8217;re in
this to help users, remember: not just the ones who think as we do, but
the ones who <em>rely on us</em> to build things for them because they don&#8217;t
know what they&#8217;re doing. If your response is honestly &#8220;well, he should
have spent more on a phone to get something better&#8221;, then I&#8217;m
exceedingly disillusioned by you. &#8220;The internet brings freedom, but only
to rich people&#8221;? Really? Is this what the Open Web, the technological
revolution is all about? If your answer is &#8220;he needs different
software&#8221;… really? Are we ever going to get past the point where saying
&#8220;I have a problem&#8221; just gets you a hundred responses about how it&#8217;s your
fault for having picked the wrong computer? We have failed as an
industry. If the best we can do is fight amongst ourselves and scratch
like cats in a bag then it&#8217;s hardly surprising we fail so badly. Then
again, perhaps we&#8217;re not in this to help people; we&#8217;re in this to make
money and helping is a sort of epiphenomenon. Some of us may be
thinking: a company who builds a product this frustrating will surely be
eliminated by the marketplace. Leaving aside for a moment how the tech
crowd, normally as liberal a group of people as you might want to meet,
become rabid free-market boosters when a product we like becomes popular
(football teams have had a chant about this pernicious behaviour for
decades now. It goes: you only sing when you&#8217;re winning), think about
all the people who get inadvertently screwed by this laissez-faire
capitalism. Every company who gets &#8220;eliminated by the market&#8221; still sold
a shedload of devices to a shedload of people, and all we have for them
is to say &#8220;soz, dude, you made the wrong choice, you&#8217;ve been eliminated
by the market, you are the weakest link, goodbye&#8221;? Can&#8217;t we do&nbsp;better?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing we can do, though! comes the cry. What can we, innocent
technical people, do to influence the movements and decisions and
marketing and choices and products of some of the largest companies on
earth? I don&#8217;t know. But take that feeling of helplessness you have
right there, and now <em>imagine how helpless you&#8217;d feel if you didn&#8217;t even
understand the technology</em>. That&#8217;s how helpless our users are when we
get it wrong, or when someone else gets it wrong and instead of helping
we tell screwed people that it&#8217;s their own fault for buying the blue
phone instead of the one we&nbsp;recommended.</p>
<p>Niamh danced superbly, by the&nbsp;way.</p>
