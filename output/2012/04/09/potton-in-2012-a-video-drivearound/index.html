		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>About six months ago I saw a YouTube video of Bedford, the nearest big
town to where I grew up, in the mid-eighties. (It probably wasn't <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyugYKsPSCU">this
one</a> but that's fairly close.) It was fascinating; we used to go
shopping in Bedford back then when I was a kid, and seeing all the shops
that are no longer there was most interesting. Anyway, I mentioned this
to my dad, and he said: we should do something like that for Potton, the
town in which I grew up (and in which my parents still live). Today we
did exactly that; since Potton is a small town, we drove down every
street in town and recorded it on video.</p>
<p>You learn a new respect for the Google Street Car people doing this, I
can tell you.</p>
<p>I wanted to add maps and details of which street was which in the video,
and after some playing around with the OpenShot video
editor<span style="color: red" title="which crashes a lot more than it should">*</span>
I worked out how to do just that. Each street gets a couple of seconds
of "title" showing its name and also where it is on a map of Potton. The
maps were made possible by <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, which is like Google Maps
crossed with Wikipedia; it's a map of the whole world, but it's created
by people and not by corporations who want money to licence it, and
therefore you're allowed to use the maps to do interesting things.</p>
<p>Warning: technical stuff about vector graphics formats coming up. Skip
this paragraph if you don't care.</p>
<p>What I did was get a map of Potton from OSM, export it as SVG, and then
go through that map in Inkscape and mark each road with the name of that
road. I was enormously pleased to see that each road on an OSM SVG is an
individual path (making this possible). OSM people: if you wanted to do
something really cool, then in an SVG export make each path have the
name of the road that it is as its ID (rather than "path2319" or
whatever). This is probably quite hard (each road has at least the path
defining the street itself, a path defining the border of that street,
and the text), but naming these as "roadHighStreet_main",
"roadHighStreet_background", and "roadHighStreet_text" or something
might be possible. Anyway, once I had an SVG with all the IDs set to be
the street names, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/make_potton_svgs.py">a quick Python script</a> was enough to turn that into
one SVG per road with that road highlighted in red. (You can get <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/Potton.svg">the
SVG of Potton with all roads marked with IDs</a> as well, if it's useful
to you.) The script also creates an "overlay SVG" for each road name as
well, so that I could overlay the road name onto the video so you can
see at any point where you are in town.</p>
<p>End of technical stuff.</p>
<p>This was a fun little project. I mean, what you've got is a video which
is nearly two hours long and is nothing but driving round a small
Bedfordshire town, so it ain't gonna win any Oscars, but I'm pleased we
did it. Maybe in twenty years someone will find this on YouTube and be
amazed at what Potton looked like in 2012.</p>
