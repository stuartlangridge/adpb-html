			<p>Just had an odd little idea.</p>
<p>Imagine you go off to a conference -- one of the ones where you wander
around and look at stuff and talk to people in corridors and so on, not
one of the ones where you sit in the same seat for the whole day and
then go home. And when you pick up your lanyard and badge, there's an
extra little stack of cards and you can take one, if you want. A card
has on it, say, ten empty boxes with "Deaths" written above them, and
it's a little bit taller than your conference badge so when you put it
in the badge case it pokes up above the badge a bit. What this means is
that taking one of the cards means you're playing the conference game,
and other people can see that you are (because the card pokes up a bit).
So, when you're walking around and you see someone else playing the
game... you Roshambo them. (That's Scissors-Paper-Stone, or
Rock-Paper-Scissors, for those who don't know the term "Roshambo".) The
loser takes out their little card and puts an X in one of their "Deaths"
boxes, in sight of the winner. Then each goes their separate ways. If
all your Deaths boxes have been Xed then you're dead and no longer
playing; put your card in your pocket.</p>
<p>No idea if this'd actually work, but I think it'd be cool. Fun little
thing to be doing while you're enjoying the conference. I can imagine it
would have worked well at LugRadio Live, for example.</p>
<h3>Extra thoughts</h3>
<p>On the back of the card, have a special move, and a number of "hour"
boxes, one per hour in the conference day. A special move would be
something like, say, "Dynamite" -- if your opponent plays rock, you
automatically win, regardless of what you yourself played. If you use a
special move to win, visibly put a tick in the corresponding hour box
(so you can only use a special move once per hour, or five times in
total, or something).</p>
<p>If it gets close to the end of the day, how do still-alive players find
one another in order to do battle? Haven't quite worked this out yet.</p>
<p>Printing up a stack of the cards would be cool, but I suppose it's not
strictly necessary -- someone can just draw themselves a card if they
want.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of sensibleness rules -- you can't fight the same
person twice in succession, for example -- in order to stop two people
fighting until one of them is eliminated from the game entirely. Of
course, given the rules lawyers, probably you need to stop three people
standing in a triangle and fighting until one is eliminated, but that's
basically covered by the generalised "don't be a dick" rule :)</p>
<p>It should be possible to tweak the cards for the particular
conference... if you've got a zillion attendees and they all want to
play, maybe you need more than ten deaths, or you get more special
moves, or whatever. That seems easy enough.</p>
<p>Let me know if you try it out.</p>
