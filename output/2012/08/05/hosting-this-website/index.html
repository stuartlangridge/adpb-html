			<p>At the moment this website is hosted on a dedicated machine leased from
<a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk">Bytemark</a>. The Bytemark team are superb, and their service is great;
if you're looking to run machines (virtual or physical) that aren't in
your house or company, go and see them. However, if there's one thing
that I've learned in the last fifteen years of running a website, it's
that I hate being a sysadmin (and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120805192900/http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a>, with whom I share the
dedicated machine, is if possible even worse than me). If the site goes
down I just bury my head in my hands, and I hate, hate, hate having to
fix it. Whether it's because Apache's crashed or the backups have
stopped working or the machine's out of disc space or there was a kernel
panic or we've been slashdotted again or it's not responding or... man,
I just don't <strong>care</strong>. I used to find this sort of thing fascinating --
having my own server, being able to fiddle with it and tweak it and
deploy what I liked -- and now I just want it to go away. So I've been
looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>This site, what with having been running for fifteen years and all, has
built up a pretty large collection of both stuff and infrastructure. So,
here are the things that I want, that I need, to preserve.</p>
<h3>A blog</h3>
<p>This blog. Lives at kryogenix.org/days. Permalinks at /days/YYYY/MM/DD.
Can be themed.</p>
<h3>Comments on the blog</h3>
<p>People can comment here. The commenting requires JavaScript already, so
I'm not averse to continuing to require that for a new thing.</p>
<h3>Arbitrary files at arbitrary URLs</h3>
<p>Over these many years, I have written and uploaded a whole bunch of
stuff here. There are images and random little uploaded things and HTML
and CSS and JavaScript files which are not part of the blog. Take, for
example, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">sorttable</a>, probably the most popular thing I've ever
written. So, these things are not part of the blog at all. I have them
already: I do not want to have to manually type them all back in again
to make them "static pages" controlled by the blogging engine.</p>
<h3>Redirect farms</h3>
<p>Back in the early days, before we (that is: mpt and Mark Pilgrim, both
of whom have since killed their sites so I'm not sure how to link to
them, and others) thought up stable permalink URLs in a standard format
(/blog/YYYY/MM/DD), and by virtue of this place having been run by about
six different blogging engines (ones I wrote myself, Moveable Type,
pyblosxom, Wordpress, the list goes on) posts here have had many, many,
many different permalinks. Also, the RSS feed has moved around a number
of times. I have a forest of redirect rules to make sure that all those
old links keep working (and 302 redirect to the newest link), and I do
not want to give that up. (Nor do I want to publish a given thing in all
possible places.)</p>
<hr>
<p>So, how can I host this site with no sysadmin overhead and still do all
the above? I'll list the options I've looked at, and whether there's
some sort of a problem with each (hint: there is) and then you clever
people can tell me about ways I can fix that or options I've missed.
<em>Nota bene:</em> I am prepared to pay for whatever I come up with, as long
as it's not too expensive; I get some money back by no longer having the
server, anyway.</p>
<h3>Completely static hosting on S3/Rackspace Cloud Files/similar</h3>
<p>It is possible to host a static website entirely on Amazon S3 and its
competition, and this seems like a good idea. It would involve using
Disqus for comments (which I am not keen on: anyone who remembers
e-net-ation or netcomments should know why (they were disqus, and went
bust taking everyone's comments with them)), but I can live with that if
I have to. The big problem here is <strong>redirects</strong>: you <em>cannot</em> do them,
as far as I can tell. So any old links to my site or my resources or my
RSS feeds will just break, or I have to multiply-publish everything that
needs redirecting, which is lame and wrong.</p>
<h3>Completely managed site, on WordPress.com/SquareSpace/Tumblr/similar</h3>
<p>I quite like this idea: it overcomes one of the other big weaknesses I
have, which is that I'm horseshit at design, by allowing me to
one-click-choose a new design, yay! However, this is a big problem
because of arbitrary files. I quite often write a new little JavaScript
experiment or something -- one HTML file, with a CSS file and a
JavaScript file, in its own folder and scp'ed to my server. This is
fourteen million times harder and more annoying if I have to manage
those pages as "Pages" controlled by the CMS. I don't want that. I want
to be able to store static content by just ftp'ing it up or something
similar. As far as I can tell, none of the full-site-management stuff
lets me do this -- understandable, since they are full-site-management
and what I'm asking for is an unmanaged bit, but a problem nonetheless.</p>
<p>(Extra bonus deficit for SquareSpace: their blog URLs are wrong! They're
/YYYY/M/D, so 2012/8/5, rather than with the 0s in place, which will
break every URL on this blog. WTF, SquareSpace? Why would you do that?
Huge disappointment.)</p>
<p>However, I'm keen on this method if someone does it in a way I can use.</p>
<h3>Old-sk00l web hosting</h3>
<p>You know, a company which gives you a cPanel control panel and FTP
access and so on. My annoyance here is that suddenly I'm a sysadmin
again, but one level up; when a new version of WordPress comes out, I
have to upgrade it myself. It would be nice to avoid that.</p>
<h3>PaaS-style hosting, like Google App Engine/heroku/dotcloud/appfog</h3>
<p>Also under consideration. I'd have to be a bit of a sysadmin again --
that is, I'd need to write (or maybe use an existing) blog engine
designed for these things, and publishing's a bit harder (I likely have
to use their command line app, rather than just FTP or similar, although
dotcloud do SSH, which makes it much harder to do from someone else's
machine), and I'd need a bunch of complicated redirection to handle all
the static content, but it's doable. One thing here is that they tend to
be oriented around "let's make it trivially easy for you to horizontally
or vertically scale your site by spinning up new instances", which is
nice but my site ain't gmail. I don't need that, really, and so it
suggests that if they're devoting their attention to making that great,
they're not doing other stuff that I do care about.</p>
<h3>Just have a server, man! it's easy, really!</h3>
<p>Go away.</p>
