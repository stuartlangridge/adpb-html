		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>At the moment this website is hosted on a dedicated machine leased from
<a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk">Bytemark</a>. The Bytemark team are superb, and their service is great;
if you&#8217;re looking to run machines (virtual or physical) that aren&#8217;t in
your house or company, go and see them. However, if there&#8217;s one thing
that I&#8217;ve learned in the last fifteen years of running a website, it&#8217;s
that I hate being a sysadmin (and <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org">Jono</a>, with whom I share the
dedicated machine, is if possible even worse than me). If the site goes
down I just bury my head in my hands, and I hate, hate, hate having to
fix it. Whether it&#8217;s because Apache&#8217;s crashed or the backups have
stopped working or the machine&#8217;s out of disc space or there was a kernel
panic or we&#8217;ve been slashdotted again or it&#8217;s not responding or&#8230; man,
I just don&#8217;t <strong>care</strong>. I used to find this sort of thing fascinating &#8212;
having my own server, being able to fiddle with it and tweak it and
deploy what I liked &#8212; and now I just want it to go away. So I&#8217;ve been
looking for&nbsp;alternatives.</p>
<p>This site, what with having been running for fifteen years and all, has
built up a pretty large collection of both stuff and infrastructure. So,
here are the things that I want, that I need, to&nbsp;preserve.</p>
<h3>A&nbsp;blog</h3>
<p>This blog. Lives at kryogenix.org/days. Permalinks at /days/<span class="caps">YYYY</span>/<span class="caps">MM</span>/<span class="caps">DD</span>.
Can be&nbsp;themed.</p>
<h3>Comments on the&nbsp;blog</h3>
<p>People can comment here. The commenting requires JavaScript already, so
I&#8217;m not averse to continuing to require that for a new&nbsp;thing.</p>
<h3>Arbitrary files at arbitrary&nbsp;URLs</h3>
<p>Over these many years, I have written and uploaded a whole bunch of
stuff here. There are images and random little uploaded things and <span class="caps">HTML</span>
and <span class="caps">CSS</span> and JavaScript files which are not part of the blog. Take, for
example, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">sorttable</a>, probably the most popular thing I&#8217;ve ever
written. So, these things are not part of the blog at all. I have them
already: I do not want to have to manually type them all back in again
to make them &#8220;static pages&#8221; controlled by the blogging&nbsp;engine.</p>
<h3>Redirect&nbsp;farms</h3>
<p>Back in the early days, before we (that is: mpt and Mark Pilgrim, both
of whom have since killed their sites so I&#8217;m not sure how to link to
them, and others) thought up stable permalink URLs in a standard format
(/blog/<span class="caps">YYYY</span>/<span class="caps">MM</span>/<span class="caps">DD</span>), and by virtue of this place having been run by about
six different blogging engines (ones I wrote myself, Moveable Type,
pyblosxom, Wordpress, the list goes on) posts here have had many, many,
many different permalinks. Also, the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed has moved around a number
of times. I have a forest of redirect rules to make sure that all those
old links keep working (and 302 redirect to the newest link), and I do
not want to give that up. (Nor do I want to publish a given thing in all
possible&nbsp;places.)</p>
<hr />
<p>So, how can I host this site with no sysadmin overhead and still do all
the above? I&#8217;ll list the options I&#8217;ve looked at, and whether there&#8217;s
some sort of a problem with each (hint: there is) and then you clever
people can tell me about ways I can fix that or options I&#8217;ve missed.
<em>Nota bene:</em> I am prepared to pay for whatever I come up with, as long
as it&#8217;s not too expensive; I get some money back by no longer having the
server,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<h3>Completely static hosting on S3/Rackspace Cloud&nbsp;Files/similar</h3>
<p>It is possible to host a static website entirely on Amazon S3 and its
competition, and this seems like a good idea. It would involve using
Disqus for comments (which I am not keen on: anyone who remembers
e-net-ation or netcomments should know why (they were disqus, and went
bust taking everyone&#8217;s comments with them)), but I can live with that if
I have to. The big problem here is <strong>redirects</strong>: you <em>cannot</em> do them,
as far as I can tell. So any old links to my site or my resources or my
<span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds will just break, or I have to multiply-publish everything that
needs redirecting, which is lame and&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<h3>Completely managed site, on&nbsp;WordPress.com/SquareSpace/Tumblr/similar</h3>
<p>I quite like this idea: it overcomes one of the other big weaknesses I
have, which is that I&#8217;m horseshit at design, by allowing me to
one-click-choose a new design, yay! However, this is a big problem
because of arbitrary files. I quite often write a new little JavaScript
experiment or something &#8212; one <span class="caps">HTML</span> file, with a <span class="caps">CSS</span> file and a
JavaScript file, in its own folder and scp&#8217;ed to my server. This is
fourteen million times harder and more annoying if I have to manage
those pages as &#8220;Pages&#8221; controlled by the <span class="caps">CMS</span>. I don&#8217;t want that. I want
to be able to store static content by just ftp&#8217;ing it up or something
similar. As far as I can tell, none of the full-site-management stuff
lets me do this &#8212; understandable, since they are full-site-management
and what I&#8217;m asking for is an unmanaged bit, but a problem&nbsp;nonetheless.</p>
<p>(Extra bonus deficit for SquareSpace: their blog URLs are wrong! They&#8217;re
/<span class="caps">YYYY</span>/M/D, so 2012/8/5, rather than with the 0s in place, which will
break every <span class="caps">URL</span> on this blog. <span class="caps">WTF</span>, SquareSpace? Why would you do that?
Huge&nbsp;disappointment.)</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m keen on this method if someone does it in a way I can&nbsp;use.</p>
<h3>Old-sk00l web&nbsp;hosting</h3>
<p>You know, a company which gives you a cPanel control panel and <span class="caps">FTP</span>
access and so on. My annoyance here is that suddenly I&#8217;m a sysadmin
again, but one level up; when a new version of WordPress comes out, I
have to upgrade it myself. It would be nice to avoid&nbsp;that.</p>
<h3>PaaS-style hosting, like Google App&nbsp;Engine/heroku/dotcloud/appfog</h3>
<p>Also under consideration. I&#8217;d have to be a bit of a sysadmin again &#8212;
that is, I&#8217;d need to write (or maybe use an existing) blog engine
designed for these things, and publishing&#8217;s a bit harder (I likely have
to use their command line app, rather than just <span class="caps">FTP</span> or similar, although
dotcloud do <span class="caps">SSH</span>, which makes it much harder to do from someone else&#8217;s
machine), and I&#8217;d need a bunch of complicated redirection to handle all
the static content, but it&#8217;s doable. One thing here is that they tend to
be oriented around &#8220;let&#8217;s make it trivially easy for you to horizontally
or vertically scale your site by spinning up new instances&#8221;, which is
nice but my site ain&#8217;t gmail. I don&#8217;t need that, really, and so it
suggests that if they&#8217;re devoting their attention to making that great,
they&#8217;re not doing other stuff that I do care&nbsp;about.</p>
<h3>Just have a server, man! it&#8217;s easy,&nbsp;really!</h3>
<p>Go&nbsp;away.</p>
