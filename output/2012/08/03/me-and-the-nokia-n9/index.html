<p>The essence of writing is to be scrupulously even-handed. Or it&#8217;s to be
shamelessly partisan and assume that fairness happens in aggregate
across everyone&#8217;s writing in total. I can&#8217;t decide. Explaining that both
these views exist is in itself being scrupulously even-handed. But
even-handedness is wishy-washy and indecisive; partisanship lets you put
across a strong full-throated defence of a position. Then, though,
partisanship is unfair and discriminatory, and the ability to see both
sides of a position is not the hallmark of an inferior intellect. So I
can&#8217;t decide. As you can see, I am indecisive. I am indecisive even
about indecisiveness. That&#8217;s the hallmark of the open source mentality,
right there. Except for the bits which are rabidly partisan and admit of
no error. Indecision even about the need for&nbsp;indecision.</p>
<p>This leads me on to the Nokia&nbsp;N9.</p>
<p>A few months back I bought an N9, and <a href="http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/03/04/my-new-phone-2012-edition">exhaustively detailed my reasons
for doing so</a>. At that stage, I liked the hardware, I liked the <span class="caps">OS</span>, I
wanted to try using web apps for most stuff, and I worried a little bit
about there being no applications. Now, three months later, I have a
more detailed set of thoughts. There&#8217;s a list of positive things and a
list of negative things. If you&#8217;re looking for a simple review, or
you&#8217;re looking for a fierce recommendation either for or against, this
is not the blog post for you. Likewise, if you&#8217;re looking for a writeup
with a bunch of numbers in it, or indeed if you&#8217;re looking for anything
pretending to be a comprehensive and overall review of the device and
all that therein is, this is also not the blog post for you. I&#8217;m going
to tell a story, or possibly just let loose with a very, very long
stream of consciousness, although in truth it&#8217;s more like a river of
consciousness or perhaps a roiling torrential waterfall of
consciousness. Sieve out the gems that apply to you, if you can. Because
I can&#8217;t decide whether I love my N9 or whether I&#8217;m annoyed by it.
Indecisive, you see. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I believe in
Nessie, to quote the late, great Arthur C. Clarke. I&#8217;ve been asked a
number of times whether I like my N9, and my standard answer has become
that for the first time in my life I have a thing that I adore but that
I wouldn&#8217;t recommend to anyone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to explain&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>First, let us be clear. The phone itself, the device, the sheer physical
<em>thing</em>, is a joy to behold. It&#8217;s lovely to hold, to look at, to play
with. Using it feels perfect; you swipe left, swipe up, swipe down. No
buttons to push. <a href="http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/portable-cathedrals/">Portable Cathedrals</a> is an admirable review of the
N9 on that aspect; I couldn&#8217;t say any of that better myself. For years
I&#8217;ve gradually been moving toward a mindset where I want things of
beauty and elegance more than I want the ability to fiddle and change,
and then yanking myself back because the ability to fiddle and change is
important, is <em>critical</em>, and I cannot cope without it when it&#8217;s gone.
So I want each in equal measure. My cake and eat it. The moon and the
stick, both. I&#8217;ve now tasted that combination with the N9, and it&#8217;s
likely spoiled me for everything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of mundane things good about it too, beyond the
combination of sheer beauty and amazement that I am able to have a
beautiful thing. The battery life is good. It&#8217;s fast and slick to use,
and I&#8217;m told the hardware is way underpowered compared with rivals,
which speaks volumes about the quality of the software work done by the
Nokia team. It&#8217;s got a bunch of sweet little features like face
recognition for photos. Swiping everything feels so obvious, so much
more so than Android where I was never really sure whether to hit Home
or Back or whatever. It distinguishes between backgrounding an app and
quitting it. (Do not listen to naysayers on this point. They are <em>not</em>
the same. There is a big distinction between putting an app off to one
side so you can come back to it later and quitting that app while being
able to restart it with session intact. If your list of open browser
tabs is your todo list, then you agree with me. It&#8217;s not about memory
management or anything so esoteric and technical; it&#8217;s about knowing
that I still have a thing, that it&#8217;s still where I put it; the same
mentality that made spatial windows in the filer a good idea. If I open
a few pages in the browser showing rules for different card games, as I
did last week on a cruise ship, I want to be able to see the list and
get them back. Hitting the &#8220;web&#8221; icon to get a new browser window should
not try and show me all the pages I&#8217;ve got open. I don&#8217;t care about
whether the underlying <span class="caps">OS</span> processes are still there, but I do care that
I <em>think</em> they are. When I put something in a particular drawer in my
kitchen so I can find it later, I am comforted that I know it&#8217;s still
there when I turn my back. End of&nbsp;sidebar.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also just like my laptop, under the covers. Time and time again
I&#8217;ve tried to work out how to do a thing from a software point of view
&#8212; I&#8217;m a developer, right? I&#8217;m interested in this stuff &#8212; and the
answer has been &#8220;how would you do it on Ubuntu? That&#8217;s how you do it on
the N9.&#8221; It uses D-Bus and upstart and python and ssh and apt. I
understand it already. Not at all a benefit for, say, my daughter, but
it certainly is for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s made and supported by a proper big company. Perfect example of
this: my extra charger. I wanted one of those little battery device
thingies that you can charge with <span class="caps">USB</span> and leave in your bag, to
re-charge the phone when it&#8217;s running down and I&#8217;m not near a socket. So
I bought <a href="http://mynokiablog.com/2012/02/28/accessories-colourful-nokia-portable-charger-sticks-nokia-dc-16/">the Nokia portable charger</a>. It&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle">squircle</a> shape,
which is the shape all through the N9 &#8212; icons on the home screen are
that shape, the waiting spinner is that shape &#8212; and it&#8217;s the same cyan
colour as my phone. It&#8217;s not some horrible black third-party cheap
flimsy plastic box. Having spent a lifetime using the hardware that one
can find that works with first arbitrary Linux distributions and now
Ubuntu, it&#8217;s rare for me to be able to buy accessories designed for the
stuff I own, let alone ones which are also elegant and themed right and
nice. This is the advantage with having Nokia on
board.<span style="color: red" title="well, it was. More on that shortly.">*</span>
This carries right through everything; Nokia have a full and
well-written <a href="http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/docs/ux/">set of <span class="caps">UX</span> guidelines</a> for N9 applications, <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/MeeGo/">good
documentation on how to build N9 apps</a> and the capabilities of the
device &#8212; I was particularly pleased with <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Resources/Library/Web/nokia-browsers/nokia-browser-85-for-meego-12-harmattan.html">the docs on how to build web
apps for the N9</a> &#8212; and in general the whole thing feels professional
and competent and like you&#8217;re in good hands. This ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;. It&#8217;s a
lot. I like&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Of course, life&#8217;s never that nice. There are a whole heap of complaints
about it&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The browser, while it&#8217;s WebKit-based, hasn&#8217;t had as much development as
those on iOS and Android. So there&#8217;s no text reflow when zooming, which
is really supernaturally annoying. The browser can&#8217;t do fullscreen &#8212;
you <em>always</em> have the address bar, making it impossible to even pretend
that a web app feels like a native app. Meego still feels like an iOS
rip-off in a bunch of ways &#8212; look at the home screen. (I admire the
Windows Phone people for going their own way in how their <span class="caps">OS</span> <em>works</em>, as
do I admire webOS; Android and Meego (and, disappointingly, Firefox <span class="caps">OS</span>
on mobile) started from a &#8220;copy iOS&#8221; sort of base, I think.) Writing Qt
apps for it uses a bunch of Meego-specific components, meaning that it&#8217;s
somewhere in between hard and impossible to test that app in your normal
Qt/<span class="caps">QML</span> environment &#8212; most other mobile platforms are like this too,
sure, but I can run <span class="caps">QML</span> apps on my Ubuntu desktop, and development would
be so much easier if I could do that with my N9 apps, but I can&#8217;t
because you don&#8217;t have the magic Meego components. Huge chunks of the
underlying Meego architecture require you to write C++ library .so files
and can&#8217;t be used from Python and PySide, making the point of saying
&#8220;look, PySide, isn&#8217;t it great&#8221; much diluted. Getting my mail from Gmail
required me to set it up in &#8220;Sync for Exchange&#8221;, a flagrant
contradiction, and that Sync for Exchange thing keeps telling me that
&#8220;The server or web address is wrong&#8221; when I go out of network for a few
minutes. Notifications about new emails appear in the events feed but
don&#8217;t disappear if I read or delete those emails from other devices. The
magnifier on text to move the cursor is annoying and under-sensitive.
Setting up a development environment is either very hard indeed, or
requires you to install a whole separate version of Qt from Nokia at
system level, which is highly likely to sod up your standard Ubuntu
system. The list of minor abrasions and annoyances extends into the&nbsp;distance.</p>
<p>Then there are the two big elephants in the room: Nokia have canned the
whole project, and no-one bought the phone anyway so there are no apps
and no community and no&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>These two are not, I think,&nbsp;unrelated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not qualified to talk about Nokia&#8217;s market positioning or the state
of the smartphone market as a whole, really. I mean, it baffles me that
Nokia obviously put together a world-class design and development team
to make the N9 and then started backing away from it before it even went
on sale, but they <em>did</em>, so there it is. And, of course, I knew that
going in. Since then, Nokia have officially canned the whole thing; not
just under-resourced the whole N9 project but cut it off entirely. So no
lovely <span class="caps">USB</span> chargers any more; no more apps from them, no more
well-written and elegant design documentation. I can rail about the
circularity of all this until the cows come home &#8212; <em>well of course
no-one bought it, you did your best to make sure they couldn&#8217;t! canning
the project because no-one bought the phone is what happens when no-one
bought it because you wouldn&#8217;t sell them it! what are you, Acorn
Computers?</em> &#8212; but that helps no-one. Cautionary tale, sure. As <a href="https://twitter.com/mpt/statuses/147638463339053056">mpt
said once</a>, &#8220;Great design makes success more likely. But Windows on
PCs shows that it isn&#8217;t necessary, and Windows Phone shows that it isn&#8217;t
sufficient.&#8221; But the fallout from this, from no-one using the N9, from
the lack of success whatever reason there is for it, is that there are
no applications, no community, no&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>This affects me more than I thought it&nbsp;would.</p>
<p>You see, I went into this thinking, well, I don&#8217;t use most of the apps
out there in the world, so I won&#8217;t be bothered by their absence. And
that&#8217;s still true. But the lack of userbase hurts me because it means
that I get Opera Syndrome. The Opera web browser is hugely competent;
it&#8217;s as good as any other browser on the market. But hardly anyone uses
it, so it doesn&#8217;t get tested, and so web things that ought to work in it
do not because developers don&#8217;t test against it; therefore new users
won&#8217;t switch to it because stuff doesn&#8217;t work in it; repeat until false.
I&#8217;ve had a similar experience with the N9, especially regarding the web
browser. It&#8217;s WebKit; it should be able to do everything that Android
and iOS web apps can. But the screen&#8217;s a little larger in size, in
pixels, so web apps switching into a &#8220;mobile&#8221; mode which were only
tested on Android and iOS don&#8217;t work sometimes. I have to use Google+&#8217;s
mobile site in &#8220;basic mobile&#8221; mode because &#8220;pretty smart mobile mode&#8221;
won&#8217;t post comments. Google Reader works fine on the mobile web, but not
G+. Many sites, as ever, assume that if you&#8217;re not Android/iOS then your
phone browser must be some sort of 1998-era <span class="caps">WAP</span> thing and serve you
rubbish super-basic <span class="caps">HTML</span>, or worse you get the &#8220;sod off you&#8217;re not
supported&#8221; message even though I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;d actually be fine. (Amazon
Cloud Reader, you are the weakest link, goodbye.) There are other
browsers &#8212; Opera, Firefox mobile &#8212; but again you hit the same issues
&#8212; they&#8217;re not official builds, because no-one uses the N9 so it&#8217;s not a
supported platform, Fx mobile is new and doesn&#8217;t do much yet (no text
reflow there either), they don&#8217;t support adding an app to the home
screen, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>There are some really quite lovely apps for the N9. The ones that come
with it are universally good. There&#8217;s a community of people writing
great apps, too; people like <a href="http://thp.io/">Thomas Perl</a>. There just aren&#8217;t many.
Also, the N9 suffers from the same problem that open-source platforms
always suffer from, which is that the community that there is is full of
people who want to tinker <em>all the time</em>, so half the development effort
is going into making wicd run on it or tweaking obscure bits of the <span class="caps">OS</span>
so that it runs 0.2% faster or other ultra-geeky things. <a href="http://xkcd.com/619/"><span class="caps">XKCD</span>
refers.</a> And tearing one another apart on minutiae, of course (&#8220;it&#8217;s
not meego, it&#8217;s maemo!&#8221; &#8220;why isn&#8217;t your app <span class="caps">GPL</span>!&#8221; etc etc. <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2010/06/23/on-annoyance-and-free-software">I refer</a>.)</p>
<p>And that ties into a larger point, which is this: I thought to myself,
I&#8217;m not that worried about the lack of native apps, because I can use
web apps for almost everything, nowadays, and they&#8217;ll be fine. I was
wrong. The mobile web world, for apps, is quite shit. Jake Archibald
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/">memorably described</a> the distinction between &#8220;look stuff up&#8221; web
sites and &#8220;do stuff&#8221; web apps: &#8220;look stuff up&#8221; are things like
Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, and &#8220;do stuff&#8221; are what we&#8217;d think of as
<em>apps</em>. &#8220;Look stuff up&#8221; sites work absolutely fine on my N9; I don&#8217;t
need a YouTube app, I just use the website. Wikipedia, <span class="caps">IMDB</span>, all that, I
get a native-feeling experience, sized and designed and working fine for
touch on a mobile-sized screen. Things like <a href="http://wherethefuckshouldigotoeat.com/">wtfsigte</a> are a lovely
experience on mobile. (Great restaurant site: <span class="caps">NSFW</span> name.) The Lanyrd
people (more Jake) have done a superb job with their mobile web app. But
&#8220;do stuff&#8221; web apps? For mobile? There are hardly any at all. Really.
There are plenty of web sites for desktop browsers, but those sites are
not mobile-friendly. You want a todo-list app? A notes app? A book
reader? Not for you. Or at least maybe these things exist but I can&#8217;t
find them. And there&#8217;s little to no motive to fix this, because everyone
who might design and build something excellent to do this is building
iOS apps or Android apps instead, so it&#8217;s not getting any better. I was
pretty frustrated by this discovery, I can tell you, and I could make
this interminably long piece twice as long by talking about why this is
and what could happen to fix it, but I&nbsp;won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&#8217;t recommend my N9 to anyone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not <em>blaming</em> anyone for this, really. It&#8217;s hardly surprising that
there&#8217;s limited support for the N9 from web devs and app devs and Nokia
when no-one uses it. It&#8217;s hardly surprising that a phone which is very
open-source friendly but has no apps has its userbase dominated by
people who care about open source issues like low-level tweaking and not
about making great apps. It&#8217;s hardly surprising that Nokia decided that
they didn&#8217;t want to be in the business of building and maintaining a
whole <span class="caps">OS</span> stack by themselves. But that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m indecisive. Do I
actually love my N9? Or do I love what it could have been? No other
platform comes close to giving me the combination of elegance and
openness; the closest out there is webOS, which is also abandoned and on
hardware that doesn&#8217;t exist any more either. Maybe Firefox <span class="caps">OS</span> will solve
this for me, but that doesn&#8217;t exist yet either. Or Ubuntu Phone. Of
course, the other thing I want is a huge, vibrant community of app
makers and accessory makers and friends and users and family, which is
what the N9 hasn&#8217;t&nbsp;got.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m stuck now. I don&#8217;t know which of those things that I want
is the best to compromise&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not very good at&nbsp;compromise.</p>
