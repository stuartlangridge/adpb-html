			<p>I like dice games. I bought <a href="http://www.lybrary.com/scarne-on-dice-p-655.html">Scarne on Dice</a> precisely to read more
about them. (And, I should note, because I like John Scarne's
mock-didactic style combined with anecdotes about hanging out with Rat
Pack Vegas gangsters in the 50s; I bought his "New Complete Guide to
Gambling" and "...on Cards" as well for the same reason.) I like the
idea of letting myself play dice games on Ubuntu and my N9, but all the
existing ones are graphically a bit iffy: in particular, the dice tend
to be shown as one single square face which is "rolled" by going blurry
and then showing a number.</p>
<p>That's not how dice work. So, in the great spirit of yak shaving, I
started thinking about writing a few dice games and then got sidetracked
into how to draw a realistic dice throw, so the dice arc over the table
and then roll properly to a halt. Now, there are few guides to how to do
this in Blender out there (as well as stuff I don't have access to like
3D Studio Max), but Blender confuses the hell out of me. After some
poking around, I also found a bunch of videos on YouTube: rendering a
rolling die seems to be a relatively common thing to do for a school
computer graphics project. One of them mentioned using POV-Ray to do the
rendering and <a href="http://ode-wiki.org/wiki">ODE</a> to do the physics. Now, I used POV-Ray, years and
years ago, and I quite like the idea of doing this sort of thing by
writing a little programming language rather than using a GUI that I
don't understand. So I looked into this a bit. ODE is a pure physics
engine: it doesn't do graphics at all. Instead, you set up the world by
setting what gravity is, adding various shapes and explaining how heavy
they are, etc, and then you tell ODE: tell me what happens at each clock
tick. ODE works it all out and just gives you the numbers back --
position and rotation of every object. It's then your job to use those
numbers to draw pictures. (This is probably laughably simple if you're
trying to, say, write Half-Life 5, but I'm trying to simulate two
perfect cubes hitting the floor, so my problem is equally simple.)</p>
<p>ODE has Python bindings, fortunately for me. And those Python bindings
come with some examples, and <a href="http://pyode.sourceforge.net/tutorials/tutorial3.html">one of those examples</a> shows a bunch of
cuboid shapes falling to the floor and being rendered with the Python
OpenGL bindings. It was the work of but a few
moments<span style="color: red" title="many moments, plus hair-pulling">*</span>
to turn that into a little program that made two cubes fall. And then I
added a bunch of keypresses which could alter where the dice were thrown
from, the force and direction with which they were thrown, how they were
rotated, that sort of thing. My goal is to get something that looks like
a realistic throw and which keeps the dice somewhere nice and central,
rather than them bouncing off one another and then off-screen (rather
like the bullets in <em>Gunmen of the Apocalypse</em>, for those of you who've
seen the Red Dwarf <em>Smeg-Ups</em> video).</p>
<p>Pleasingly for myself, I now have that. You can <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/dicethrow.py">grab the code</a>
(requires <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/python-pyode/">python-pyode</a> and <a href="https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/python-opengl/">python-opengl</a>) if you're looking for
a trivial example of how to render a dice throw with PyODE and PyOpenGL;
Space re-throws the dice, and the keys mentioned in brackets tweak the
parameters listed on screen. Next step is to use it to generate a bunch
of dice throws I'm happy with, and then write something similar which
generates POV-Ray input files for each frame, and then make the cubes be
dice in POV-Ray, and then finally I'll have realistic looking animations
for dice!</p>
<p>At which point I can get back to actually writing the games, which was
the point of this. Still, this yak, while not entirely shaved, has a
considerably closer haircut than before.</p>
