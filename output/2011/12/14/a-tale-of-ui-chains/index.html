			<h3 style="display:block">or, big UI oaks do from little tech decisions grow</h3>
<h3 style="display:block">or, how Thunderbird screwed me a bit, although it might be my own fault</h3>
<p>I have five levels of caring about
email.<span style="color:red" title="Those of you who have one level which is 'email? who uses email?' are cordially invited to bugger off and check your Facebook">*</span>
They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't care</li>
<li>I've dealt with this</li>
<li>I probably ought to deal with this, or it prompts a thought, or
    something</li>
<li>I need to deal with this</li>
<li>I really, really need to deal with this</li>
</ol>
<p>These levels get mapped to my inbox in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleted</li>
<li>Archived (in an Archive folder)</li>
<li>In the inbox, read</li>
<li>In the inbox, unread</li>
<li>In the inbox, flagged Important (and probably marked unread too)</li>
</ol>
<p>In four years of dealing with my work inbox through Evolution, this
scheme has stood me in good stead. However, at the weekend I moved to
Thunderbird 9, and two days later it screwed me. Or I screwed myself
while it stood by and laughed. Or something. And it's all because my
work IMAP account doesn't seem to have a Trash folder. Follow the
bouncing ball...</p>
<p>When you set up a new IMAP account in Thunderbird, it asks where you
want deleted messages to go. The default setting is "Move it to this
folder: Deleted", which is what I have set for my gmail account.</p>
<p><img alt="thunderbird settings" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/thunderbird-delete-email.png"></p>
<p>However, for my work account, this complained that there was no such
folder. Now, there's a Deleted folder, with little green rubbish bin
icon<span style="color:red" title="that's an icon of a rubbish bin, not a bin icon that's rubbish">*</span>,
in the left-hand sidebar under my work account as well. Clicking on that
also says that "The current operation on 'Deleted' did not succeed. The
mail server for account (myworkemail) responded: Mailbox doesn't exist:
Trash."</p>
<p>OK, thought I... maybe that's not meant to work. Perhaps Canonical IS
don't want me storing all my deleted emails on the server or something.
However, I can't find a way of specifying a local folder as the Deleted
folder for my IMAP account.</p>
<p>Now, I delete mail by accident all the time. So I was rather too scared
to set "Remove [the mail] immediately" as my
what-happens-when-I-press-delete-by-accident thing. Hence, the other
option is to "just mark [the email] as deleted". What this does is it
~~strikes through~~ the line describing the email in my inbox, so I can
later on "undelete" it if I want. That seemed OK for a couple of days.
However (this is the second level of however), what that actually means
is that you end up with the list of emails you can see in the window all
being struck through, which is annoying. So I need a way of saying
"fine, all those deleted emails are actually deleted and not just me
hitting delete by accident", and that's "Compact" on the folder context
menu.</p>
<p><img alt="thunderbird context menu" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/images/thunderbird-context-menu.png"></p>
<p>However (third however level), immediately below "Compact" is "Mark
Folder Read". So you can see that an inept person might accidentally
click on the wrong menu item, and that's exactly what I did. And now I
can't tell the difference between the 200 emails that I need to deal
with and the other 200 that I might want to think about at some point,
which is extremely irritating. All because I don't understand why my
work email doesn't have a Trash folder.</p>
<p>I can't really <em>blame</em> the Thunderbird team for this. (Not that that
stopped me when I did it, but I calmed down.) "Mark Folder Read" and
"Compact" are both <em>destructive</em>, <em>non-reversible</em> actions. They're both
hidden on a folder context menu, a place for experts. If I bitch that I
ought to be able to undo making a folder read, then I should also bitch
that I ought to be able to undo compacting, and that defeats the point:
compacting is itself the undo mechanism for deleting! So I'm screwed and
it's no-one else's fault, which normally means (reluctantly) that it's
my fault.</p>
<p>Some of you will now be thinking: that's what you get for indicating a
permanent state ("I need to deal with this") with an ephemeral marker
(read status). And you're right, I suppose. However, email has an
Important flag and that's it. There isn't an Important and a Very
Important flag. Oh, there might be extensions to add that, but I'd want
the status to show up, and be changeable, from the folder list (not just
from an individual email). So clearly I need to change my habits.
Perhaps there's an extension which colours the lines in the folder list
differently depending on a flag I add? If I can change that colour from
the folder list then that might be a good approach. How do you deal with
differing levels of importance in email? Your thoughts are invited.</p>
