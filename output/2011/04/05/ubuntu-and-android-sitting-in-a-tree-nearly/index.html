			<p>Today I helped <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce</a> be able to screencast his Android phone, so
that he could easily do a presentation showing something on his phone.
That is: plug the phone into his laptop, and show, on the laptop's
screen, what's on the phone's screen.</p>
<p>An app exists for this: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/androidscreencast/">androidscreencast</a>. The
<abbr title="too long; didn't read">tl;dr</abbr> summary of this whole
thing is: use androidscreencast, it's cool. The rest of this is really
about Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Here is how this installation process should have worked for Bruce on
his Ubuntu machine, in an ideal world.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the link on the androidscreencast page saying "Install the
    Android SDK", which would have asked for his password and then
    immediately installed that SDK on Ubuntu, no further interaction
    required.</li>
<li>Click on the "Click HERE" link on the androidscreencast page, which
    would have immediately launched the androidscreencast application
    and shown his phone's screen on his laptop.</li>
</ol>
<p>It wasn't quite that smooth. However, pretty much all of the reasons
that it wasn't that smooth are fixable. I've tried to find bugs for all
of these; specifically, I suspect that what these bugs need is someone
to think, "I want Ubuntu to be a brilliant environment for developing
Android applications", and so take them in hand. Maybe that's you?</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Clicking the link on the androidscreencast page saying "Install the
Android SDK" and having that immediately start installing it would
require the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>That link should be to apt.ubuntu.com, referencing an Android SDK
    package. This would be fairly easy to convince the androidscreencast
    team to do, if the rest of this list existed, I think, and failing
    that the Android SDK site itself could and should point at the
    Ubuntu package for Ubuntu users.</li>
<li>The Android SDK would need packaging for Ubuntu. Someone seems to
    have filed an <abbr title="Intent To Package">ITP</abbr> for the
    Android SDK in Debian (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=459219">Debian bug 459219</a>, but that was in 2008
    and I don't think anyone's picked it up since.)</li>
<li>Since the Android SDK isn't likely to end up in the main section of
    the Ubuntu archive (although: could it? I don't want to get into
    lawyerly discussions, but it seems to be open source, no?), it'd
    need to be in the Canonical partner repository.</li>
<li>The Canonical partner repository does not seem to be enabled by
    default, at least on Bruce's Ubuntu 10.10 machine, and it should be
    so enabled. (This seems to be <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/635003">Ubuntu bug 635003</a>, although I'm a
    bit confused by that bug.)</li>
<li>The Android SDK applications won't work as a normal user, because
    you need to add a special udev rule to give the user permission.
    This is <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/316215">Ubuntu bug 316215</a> and is fixed in the upcoming Ubuntu
    11.04, hooray!</li>
</ol>
<p>With all those things done, clicking a link on the androidscreencast
website would pop up an "enter your password" dialog and then install
the Android SDK. Excellent.</p>
<p>Clicking the "Click HERE" link should launch the androidscreencast
application.</p>
<p>That link is a <em>Java Web Start</em> link. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">Java Web Start</a> is a fairly
neat Java thing; you click on a simple link in a web page, that link
leads to a file describing a Java application, your computer gets that
file and then uses the description to download and run the Java
application itself. To make this work in Ubuntu:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking a Java Web Start (jnlp) link should do something when you
    don't have Java installed. This is much like the idea that when you
    first hit a Flash-using website in Ubuntu, you get the "plugin
    finder" window which leads you through installing Flash. It ought to
    be possible to write a very tiny .jnlp handler which informs the
    user that they've tried to run a Java Web Start application and
    helps them install Java, and ship that handler by default. (Note:
    I'm sure there are plenty of people who will now say: why is Java so
    special? If we do that, then why don't we ship something to handle
    AutoCAD files by default and offer to install DraftSight, or handle
    PPT files by default and offer to install LibreOffice Impress. Well:
    why don't we? Sounds like a good idea to me. I mean, running a
    command in the terminal will offer to install the package it's in.
    Why not help normal users as well as terminal users? According to
    <a href="http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/2347/">Ubuntu Brainstorm suggestion 2347</a> and its duplicates, this
    already <em>exists</em> in Ubuntu (which is weird because I've never, ever
    seen it) but if it does then we should add jnlp files to it. It
    seems to have existed in gnome-app-install, which no longer exists;
    does Software Centre do this? It seems not.)</li>
<li>Java is not installed by default (which is fine), and it's already
    in the Canonical partner repository. However, the partner repository
    is not installed by default (as above).</li>
<li>If a user wants to install Java, and they know enough technically to
    know that what they want is to install Java, then they might take
    the approach of searching for "java" in the Ubuntu Software Centre.
    However, that brings up "OpenJDK Java 6 Runtime" as the top hit,
    then something named "IcedTea", and the actual "Sun" official Java
    nowhere. (To find the real Java, you have to look in the "technical
    items", and then <em>know</em> that you want the Java from Sun (who are now
    Oracle anyway!), and then find packages named <code>sun-java-something</code>.
    Even I barely know how to do this.) I mean, I'm all in favour of
    suggesting that people try the open-source flavours of Java, but in
    my experience they hardly ever work for existing Java apps that
    weren't written with them in mind; we're currently promoting them
    not only over the real "Sun" Java, but exclusively <em>instead of</em> the
    real Java. This will not make people wanting to use Java apps very
    happy. (If you're about to write a comment saying that OpenJDK is
    the real Java and I'm wrong: try and resist it.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixing those few things would make Java Web Start applications work
really neatly on Ubuntu, which would be pretty cool. It would also make
Android screencasting work really neatly on Ubuntu, which would also be
pretty cool. Good work to the androidscreencast people: once all the
jigsaw pieces were in place, your app Just Worked, and the jigsaw being
so complex isn't your fault.</p>
<p>So... sorry, Bruce: as you note, what I had to do was <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/55036048564162560"><em>terminal magic
followed by editing some weird java xml shit</em></a>. I would have liked to
not have to do it, especially since if I hadn't been through all this
before for myself it would have taken hours rather than minutes. I'll
cross my fingers that someone would like to make Ubuntu the best
platform to build phone apps for Android on.</p>
