		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>So, there I was at the <a href="http://www.multipack.co.uk/">multipack</a> meetup in Birmingham yesterday
chatting away to a bunch of people in the sun, including
<a href="https://twitter.com/simonbanyard">@simonbanyard</a> who&#8217;s decided to get into web development in a proper
way. We were kicking around which web dev stack he should learn, which
was entertaining &#8212; <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Python + Django, Python + something other than
Django, node, Rails, .<span class="caps">NET</span>, whatever. In an effort to explain to him
about web stacks, I came up with the following&nbsp;analogy.</p>
<p>The three web dev stacks that you probably should choose between are
<a href="http://php.net"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, and Python. They map quite neatly, in a handwavy
philosophical overall feel sort of way, onto the three operating systems
that you&#8217;re likely to choose between, Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, and Ubuntu, as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<h3><span class="caps">PHP</span> =&nbsp;Windows</h3>
<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> is ubiquitous. Everyone&#8217;s got at least a little bit of knowledge of
it; everyone&#8217;s used it; most people got started with it. It works
everywhere; it&#8217;s got the biggest community. It&#8217;s a bit clunky, in part
because it&#8217;s grown organically and is full of stuff that was put in to
fix a need five or ten years ago and still hangs around because people
use it. It doesn&#8217;t really stop you from doing regrettable things; you
look back two years after your first piece of work and you&#8217;ll think,
ugh, why did I do that, I know so much better now. But, importantly, if
you know what you&#8217;re doing it&#8217;s entirely capable of greatness, and way
too many people wrongly assume that anything done with it must by
definition be&nbsp;rubbish.</p>
<h3>node = <span class="caps">OS</span>&nbsp;X</h3>
<p>This is very cool, and very, very good at its job; the best thing
available right now. It&#8217;s where the trendsetters are. It is <em>so</em> much
the future that everyone else will be copying it a couple of years from
now and if you&#8217;re into it, you&#8217;ll be in on the ground floor and able to
be smug about it when your friends finally follow you over. They have no
hesitation in breaking backwards compatibility in order to make a better
product in the future, which means that if you stick with old versions
you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ve been rather pushed out to sea on a dwindling ice
floe and all the new hotness just isn&#8217;t available to you. And there are
a fair few people using it not because they&#8217;ve really sat down and
decided to do so, but because their hip idols are doing it and they&#8217;re
following along&nbsp;behind.</p>
<h3>Python =&nbsp;Ubuntu</h3>
<p>After years of being scattershot and having no plan, this finally got
itself together and delivered a pretty good stack. Importantly, you&#8217;ll
find yourself having to understand the underpinnings of this slightly
more than you&#8217;d perhaps like to in order to properly get into it. It&#8217;s
not quite as easy or as futuristic as the others, but it really does
make sense for everything you want to do once you get over that first
hump. Once you&#8217;re into it you&#8217;ll do everything with it and wonder how
you ever did without; until that point, you won&#8217;t really see it as being
all that good, and it&#8217;s undeniably not quite as well-polished as it
could&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>Now you get to overextend the metaphor by complaining about&nbsp;it.</p>
