		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I want a new laptop. After nearly three years with my Dell M1330, I've
been trying to come up with a set of requirements for whatever I buy
next, and they end up based around things that I've found annoying with
my Dell. Now, to be honest, there isn't much. I like my M1330, mostly.
However, there is one thing that's viciously annoying: it's too heavy.</p>
<p>What? I hear you say. 1.94kg is too heavy? What are you, a
six<span style="color:red" title="-teen">*</span>-stone weakling?</p>
<p>The reason it's too heavy is this: when I'm at a conference, I carry the
laptop, with its 6-cell battery, and two 9-cell batteries, and the power
supply which is a huge great big brick of a thing. And my shoulder
hurts.</p>
<p>So, there I was thinking: what I want is a laptop which will last a
whole day without recharging, and has a really small power supply as
well.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: "Runs Ubuntu perfectly" is, of course, another requirement.
And you'd have to talk pretty fast to persuade me that buying a laptop
without Ubuntu already on it is a good idea. End sidebar.</em></p>
<p>So, I had a number of semi-related thoughts, which looked like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not buy a netbook? No, that's a crap idea. I don't want two
    computers. I want one which is
    perfect.<span style="color: red" title="And the moon, obviously. On a long implement of your choice.">*</span></li>
<li>Clearly ARM is the way to go here. You get 7 hours life! Off a
    3-cell battery! Even given that every laptop manufacturer on the
    planet could bullshit their way through a solid brick wall when it
    comes to expected battery life, that's still <em>easily</em> enough for a
    whole day and more besides if you threw an 8-cell or 9-cell battery
    in it. Gimme gimme gimme.</li>
<li>Now, hang on. I've been hearing "there'll be ARM laptops this time
    next year" for the last decade at least. I mean, the bloody <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=31">Acorn A4</a> was an ARM
    laptop<span style="color:red" title="sort of, in the same way that Leonardo da Vinci's pencil sketches were sort of Airwolf">*</span>
    fergawdsake and that was in 1991, and that was the last real one
    that existed. ARM laptops are not just jam tomorrow but jam,
    marmalade, peanut butter, honey, and Mrs. H. S. Ball's Original
    Peach Chutney tomorrow. How many more times do you have to get
    burned by this expectation, Charlie
    Brown?<span style="color: red" title="By the way, the words you're looking for are 'Oh, good grief.' - Jed Bartlet">*</span></li>
<li>My phone's got an ARM chip in.</li>
<li>My phone's got a bloody small power supply, too; thin cable, small
    plug, just what I want for a laptop. Charges over USB too, if I need
    it to.</li>
<li>Hey, that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110620112700/http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/GB-EN/Consumer-Products-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-ATRIX-GB-EN">Motorola Atrix</a> thingy where you plug your phone into a
    "lapdock" and it becomes a laptop powered by the phone is a good
    idea, isn't it?</li>
<li>Hey, that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110620112700/http://event.asus.com/mobile/padfone/">Asus Padfone</a> thingy where you plug your phone into a
    tablet shell and it becomes a tablet powered by the phone is a good
    idea, isn't it?</li>
<li>Hey, that <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_TF101/">Eee Pad Transformer</a> thingy where it's a tablet that
    docks into a keyboard to become a laptop is a good idea, isn't it?</li>
<li>Wouldn't it be nice if my phone and tablet and laptop all shared the
    same data?</li>
<li>64GB micro SD cards exist now, don't they?</li>
</ol>
<p>...and all these thoughts lead me towards the idea of having my phone,
which runs Android on top of a Linux kernel, plugging into a "laptop"
which can also be separated into a "tablet", and which runs Ubuntu.
Since all the storage and CPU are in the phone, the "laptop" bit can
basically be entirely full of batteries (maybe some extra RAM, I don't
know) and so it'll have superb battery life, especially since it's ARM
and therefore lasts longer anyway.</p>
<p>So, something combining the Atrix, the Eee Pad, and a standard socket so
any "enabled" mobile phone can plug into
it<span style="color:red" title="yes, I know manufacturers won't let other phones plug into it. But they should, and they will eventually. Just do it at the beginning.">*</span>.
That's what I want. For Christmas — and this is not a joke; I actually
want to be able to buy this for myself by Christmas 2011 — please,
manufacturers. Is anyone working on this? I suspect that, like most of
the stuff I want, it doesn't and will not exist, but maybe I can get
close...?</p>
