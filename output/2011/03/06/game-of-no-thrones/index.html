		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I like <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, George R. R. Martin's long and
partially completed fantasy cycle. (Memorably described by mightygodking
as <a href="http://mightygodking.com/index.php/2008/10/20/mgk-versus-his-adolescent-reading-habits/">Knights Who Say "Fuck"</a>.) HBO, the American TV channel, is making
it into a series called <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a>, and it looks pretty
excellent to me. <abbr title="George R. R. Martin">GRRM</abbr> is
heavily involved in the production, so this won't be one of those books
that suffers horribly in the transition to celluloid (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/">Constantine</a>,
I'm looking at you) but it seems that they're not afraid to change
things where it makes most sense, so it's not a slavish adaption
designed to only please the hardcore fans (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/">Watchmen</a>, now I'm looking
at you.)</p>
<p>I've been reminding myself of the plots of the first four books (the
fifth book, <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, is <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/198122.html">coming out on July 12th</a>!!!)
by re-reading them all, and I now have full character biographies for
all the books on my phone via <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jrosenblum">a neat little aSoIaF Android app</a>
(there's apparently an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-companion/id400598887?mt=8">iPhone one too</a>). Anticipation grows mightily.</p>
<p>You see, in addition to HBO (which I can't get, being in Blighty), <em>Game
of Thrones</em> is being shown on Sky Atlantic here in the UK. So I thought
to myself: maybe I should subscribe, so I can watch
<abbr title="Game of Thrones">GoT</abbr> each week. However, I'm not a
Sky subscriber, and I don't want another box in my house. Fortunately,
Sky are aware of people like me, and allow you to subscribe just to
watch online, either monthly or on an episode-by-episode basis. Nice one
Sky TV.</p>
<p>Big downside, though: the <a href="http://skyplayer.sky.com/">online Sky Player</a> requires Silverlight.</p>
<p>Now, we have <a href="http://go-mono.com/moonlight/">Moonlight</a> for that. The <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/moonlight-plugin-mozilla">version in Ubuntu</a> appears
to be heroically out of date (it's Silverlight 2, and the Sky Player
requires Silverlight 4), but you can download a Firefox extension direct
from the Moonlight website which is Silverlight 4. Nice and easy. (The
Moonlight page says they only test on Ubuntu 9.10 (wtf?) but it works
fine on 11.04 for me and so presumably will work in interim versions
including 10.04 LTS.) And once that's installed, it starts up OK on the
Sky Player site.</p>
<p>Doesn't work, though. Now, at the moment, there's a <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677240">bug</a> in the way
which throws some kind of traceback, but it looks rather as even were
that bug fixed the Sky Player still wouldn't work on Ubuntu, because the
Sky streams all use DRM, which is <a href="http://go-mono.com/moonlight/faq.aspx">not supported by Moonlight</a> (see
"Does Netflix work with Moonlight?") and likely won't be; the problem
isn't technical, but seems to be that Microsoft won't licence PlayReady
DRM for desktop (read: non-embedded) Linux distribution. There is
speculation that this is because embedded use is harder to
reverse-engineer, but no-one seems to really know for sure except
Microsoft, and they're not telling.</p>
<p>Anyway: as far as I can tell, this puts me shit out of luck. No-one has
<em>Game of Thrones</em> except HBO (which I can't get) and Sky Atlantic (who
won't support Ubuntu). Damn.</p>
