			<p>The <a href="http://www.openschoolsalliance.org/">Open Schools Alliance</a> are asking people to write to their <span class="caps">MP</span> in
support of an <a href="http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31752&amp;SESSION=885">Early Day Motion</a> by John Pugh, <span class="caps">MP</span>. It&nbsp;reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That this House congratulates the Open University and other schools,
colleges and universities for utilising free and open source software
to deliver cost-effective educational benefit not just for their own
institutions but also the wider community; and expresses concern that
Becta and the Department for Education and Skills, through the use of
outdated purchasing frameworks, are effectively denying schools the
option of benefiting from both free and open source and the value and
experience small and medium <span class="caps">ICT</span> companies could bring to the schools&nbsp;market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m entirely in favour of this campaign. Every time I go to Niamh&#8217;s
school I think that they could be doing so much more with <span class="caps">IT</span> if it
wasn&#8217;t that they can&#8217;t do what they want. Sam tells horror stories about
software for teachers. It needs fixing. So I wrote to my <span class="caps">MP</span>. Why don&#8217;t
you <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">write to your <span class="caps">MP</span></a> too, if you&nbsp;agree?</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Lynda Waltho, John Pugh <span class="caps">MP</span> has tabled Early Day Motion number 179,
entitled Software in Education, which I found at
<a href="http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31752&amp;SESSION=885">http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?<span class="caps">EDMID</span>=31752&amp;<span class="caps">SESSION</span>=885</a>.
The text of the <span class="caps">EDM</span> refers to the Open University and other educational
institutions using free and open-source software, and expresses concern
that Becta and the DfES are effectively denying schools the best choice
of software by making it difficult for them to use open source. Open
Source software is software that is free of cost to everyone, and can be
worked on by everyone. You may have heard of Linux, which is an
open-source alternative to Microsoft Windows. Linux is created by a
worldwide community of computer programmers, some employed by large
organisations such as <span class="caps">IBM</span> and others devoting their free time to it. The
idea behind open source software is that it gives <span class="caps">IT</span> staff the freedom
to work with the software that they have; they can make changes to it to
make it better or more appropriate to them, and the software isn&#8217;t
controlled by one organisation who can refuse to fix the problems you
find in it. You can find out more about open source software at
<a href="http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php">http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php</a>. Speaking as one
of your constituents, as an <span class="caps">IT</span> professional, and a father with a
6-year-old daughter at [redacted] School, I&#8217;d like to encourage our
government to encourage schools to look at open source software as a way
of saving cost and of helping schools work together to make the software
that they need, rather than the software that large companies choose to
give them. The e-Government unit published a report recommending that
government agencies look at open source software as a strong candidate
for software rollouts, with phrases such as &#8220;<span class="caps">UK</span> Government will seek to
avoid lock-in to proprietary <span class="caps">IT</span> products and services&#8221;, and &#8220;<span class="caps">UK</span>
Government will only use products for interoperability that support open
standards and specifications in all future <span class="caps">IT</span> developments&#8221;. (I read
their report at
<a href="http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/policydocs/policydocs_document.asp?docnum=905">http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/policydocs/policydocs_document.asp?docnum=905</a>
but you may have access to it some other way.) The issue that John
Pugh&#8217;s <span class="caps">EDM</span> is hoping to address is that schools receive questionable
advice on <span class="caps">IT</span> procurement from Becta, the government agency responsible
for the use of <span class="caps">IT</span> in education. <span class="caps">BECTA</span>&#8217;s framework agreements look only
at the long-term financial performance of suppliers, which seriously
hampers the involvement of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
There are large software houses which tender to the education market,
but there are real opportunities for SMEs to become involved in software
provision; this would allow a small software house to concentrate very
specifically on a particular area of educational software, which brings
employment across the country (rather than just at large 1000+ employees
conglomerates). Concentrating on solely large enterprises ignores the
risk that schools could become locked into expensive and restrictive
contractual arrangements. Becta&#8217;s lists of approved suppliers are very
limited both in number and variety - only fifteen suppliers for
non-curriculum software for example, none of which has any commitment to
open source software despite both the e-Government report above and that
Becta&#8217;s own case studies found considerable savings in cost for schools
using open source software. Thanks for reading through this. I&#8217;d like to
urge you to consider adding your name to John Pugh&#8217;s Early Day Motion.
I&#8217;d be happy to talk to you further about this issue if you feel you&#8217;d
like more information! Yours sincerely, Stuart&nbsp;Langridge</p>
