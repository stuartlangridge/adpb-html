			<ol>
<li>If someone requests support in a channel and you&#8217;re around and don&#8217;t
    know the answer, be sure to not say anything so they can&#8217;t tell the
    difference between you not knowing and you not being around. That
    way you can complain that users don&#8217;t wait for answers, even if
    those answers are never going to&nbsp;come.</li>
<li>If a user hasn&#8217;t read all of your website, all the mailing list
    archives, the wiki, the old wiki, all the blogs of all the
    developers, and the text files in <span class="caps">CVS</span>, refuse to answer their
    question. They should study harder before they&#8217;re entitled to ask&nbsp;questions.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bother to write stuff down. If a user asks a question which
    they could have worked out by spending two years studying the code,
    then they should have spent that two&nbsp;years.</li>
<li>Remember, you understand this software. If someone wants to use it
    to get their work done, they should be prepared to understand all
    aspects of it in detail as well as you do. All users should be&nbsp;developers.</li>
<li><span class="caps">NEVER</span> thank people for feedback. If they have comments on the
    program, they should be sending in&nbsp;patches.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a lot more important to finish rewriting the <span class="caps">XML</span> library your
    program uses for the third time than it is to fix a bug that makes
    every Fedora user crash their whole desktop. They should be using
    Slackware&nbsp;anyway.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re an influential developer at all, your opinion matters more
    than the users. Follow the previous rule, as it will definitely
    produce a positive outcome. Be sure to relate the users in question
    to mentally ill people and&nbsp;excrement.</li>
<li>What you think users will do is more important than what users
    actually&nbsp;do.</li>
<li>Don’t use punctuation or bother with the spell checking. This slows
    down the communication between you and the&nbsp;user.</li>
<li>Insult the user. This establishes control, which is important.
    Support should be thought of as a battle. Popular insults include
    “asshole,” “mother f**ker,” “dipshit,” and “newb.” Insulting their
    mother is another good way of establishing&nbsp;control.</li>
<li>If you’re confused by the “bug report” that the user is giving you,
    don’t feel bad, as this isn’t your fault. This is the user’s fault.
    Users live in a different world. They’re besuited, annoying, stupid
    people who aren’t able to clearly get points across. Tell them this,
    as they probably don’t realize it. It is sure to ease the&nbsp;communication.</li>
<li>As a developer, you know clearly what users will want to do with the
    software better than they do. If they say something about the
    software, take it with a grain of salt. They&#8217;re only the people who
    actually try out your theories; you&#8217;re the one who came up with&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Insist that all users run <span class="caps">CVS</span> or svn <span class="caps">HEAD</span>. If they&#8217;re using your
    latest release stable version, they should be prepared to checkout
    <span class="caps">CVS</span> and compile it before commenting on it. A version release or
    downloadable binary distribution means nothing when there&#8217;s
    something newer available from source&nbsp;control.</li>
<li>If someone you know tells you how they would use your software, and
    someone who actually uses it tells you differently, trust the person
    you know; after all, you know them. This is doubly important if the
    person you know is another&nbsp;developer.</li>
<li>Documentation is a pointless waste of time. If someone complains
    that they&#8217;re finding it difficult to do anything with your program
    because there&#8217;s nothing written anywhere on how to use it, then tell
    them to read the source; that&#8217;s good&nbsp;enough.</li>
<li>If someone files a bug which turns out to be a duplicate, be sure to
    let them know how stupid they were when you link the two bugs. This
    is particularly important if the two bugs share no words in common
    whatsoever and only turn out to be duplicates after a week of
    digging and thought by you; after all, you had to work much harder&nbsp;then!</li>
<li>Anyone who switches away from your program to someone else&#8217;s is
    clearly both stupid and an enemy of free software. You&#8217;re lucky to
    get rid of&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Programming ability and usability engineering are the same thing. If
    you know how to write code, you know about usability already; you
    certainly don&#8217;t need to waste time studying&nbsp;it.</li>
