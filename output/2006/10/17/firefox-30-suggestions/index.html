		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>The Firefox people, just about to release version 2.0 of the browser,
have put up <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org./Firefox/Feature_Brainstorming">a wiki page asking for feature requests and suggestions for future Firefoxes</a>. Now, that to me sounds like a great idea. And then
I looked at the list. There are already about four hundred suggestions
on the list. As far as I can tell, damned nearly every one of them is
useless. Let's examine the reasons for uselessness.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Things that already exist</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"I would like to see an option that would allow me to click on a
    link and it open in a new window or tab and not leave the page
    I'm on until the new window/tab has fully loaded." That's
    load-tabs-in-the-background, which I have turned on right now.</li>
<li>"When a numeric portion of the URL in the address bar is
    highlighted, allow it to be incremented/decremented using the
    mouse wheel." If you want <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/pornzilla/">Pornzilla</a>, you know where to find
    it.</li>
<li>"Or a variant that could be run from an usb stick, that you
    could use your personalised browser anywhere." <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Portable Firefox</a>.</li>
<li>"Make it possible to have firefox started as a new process with
    a switch (firefox.exe -np) to be able to have two instances
    running in case you are testing something that crashes the
    browser." Just create a second profile and launch with it.</li>
<li>"Tab Exposé". <a href="http://viamatic.com/blogs/index.php/firefox">Foxpose</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Things that clearly belong in an extension</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"These days, we seem to be only allowed to "save as" in HTML or
    text. This then means we have to use time-consuming external
    programs instead of it being a quick and easy drop-down
    selection. Please give us back our old "save as" options <em>[ed:
    as PDF, etc]</em>and also include a new ODF "save as" option." This
    sort of thing is operating system level, not Firefox level.
    Install CutePDF on Windows; Macs can already print to PDF;
    everything can already print to PostScript. I can vaguely see
    the use of some of these, but "I want to save this as
    PostScript" is such a geek edge-case anyway that doing it
    through Print To File is hardly a barrier.</li>
<li>"I found a plug-in for Firefox that colored your tabs, but it
    was random. I would like to see user-picked colors for specific
    domains." Interesting use-case (a synaesthete), and he says
    he'll write it himself, so that's good; it's an extension,
    though. Not Firefox core.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Things that are basically impossible to do</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Sessions/Tabs Isolation: Make sure sessions from other tabs do
    not leak between tabs. This is a major security hazard." What
    this means is that every tab is an independent browser.
    Firefox's memory usage would go through the roof. This goes
    double for people who say "one tab crashing shouldn't crash
    anything else", which means that every tab is a separate
    <em>process</em>.</li>
<li>"Make the browser open faster; that is the number one reason
    that I have heard for people not using Firefox or switching from
    Firefox." I love this. As if they could easily do this but have
    deliberately made it slow to annoy people.</li>
<li>"Use heuristics to try and avoid caching sensitive data for
    autocompletion. For example, if something looks like a credit
    card number or social security number, don't cache it." I assume
    that means "like a <em>US</em> Social Security number", right? Or will
    you not mind if you enter what you think is a phone number and
    it refuses to cache it because it looks like a Russian SSN?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Make Firefox into Internet Explorer</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Allow an option run a downloaded setup file (in the place of
    "open") instead of saving it, like in Internet Explorer." There
    is a <em>reason</em> it doesn't do this. It should not be easy to click
    a web exe and have it run!</li>
<li>"Add fallback mode to support non-standards based rendering when
    "IE only" features are present in a web page so that the page
    will render correctly." This means: completely implement total
    compatibility with IE. As if it were made easy by saying it. Let
    alone that Firefox policy is generally, when faced with a
    choice, to do it right rather than to emulate IE.</li>
<li>"I know it might be heretical, but it would make life easier for
    some of us Ajaxy types if Firefox bit the bullet and supported
    IE style drag and drop." I'm sure it would.</li>
<li>There are quite a few "turn Firefox into Opera" requests, too.
    Why not just use Opera if that's what you want?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Things that are moronic</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Allow us to specify which order each plugin will sit in." Why?
    WHy is this even remotely useful?</li>
<li>"Send Theme name and version currently in use in the HTTP
    headers."</li>
<li>"dual screened tabs. two tabs showing in the same window pane,
    almost like frames. with ability to drag and resize viewing area
    between the two tabs." Just open a second window!</li>
<li>"Make proprietary Anchor mode: Make possible custom anchors like
    this:url#custom(0,555), this would make firefox scroll 0pixel
    to left and 555pixel down." Why is it a good idea to make only
    Firefox understand these? Did we learn nothing at all from the
    mid-nineties?</li>
<li>"Show the MD5 Checksum of each download after its finishied."
    Why? What's the point? If you even understand the <em>word</em> MD5
    you're quite capable of running md5sum, and if the website
    doesn't publish md5s then it's useless information anyway!</li>
<li>"Move all MPL code to GPL." Yes! Make that suggestion to
    Microsoft for IE as well!</li>
<li>"Rather than pop up annoying dialogs when a site has a bad
    security certificate, simply perform the encryption without
    showing the lock icon." What do you think certificates are
    <em>for</em>? Yes, it's a pain to see the window, and yes, the window's
    not brilliantly designed, but the answer isn't just to turn it
    off!</li>
<li>"I think the possibility to setup and use a socket connection
    for client-server communications would be a great improvement
    for Firefox to use it in Web2.0 / intranet-webapplications. I
    know it's already possible, but it requires 'signed/secure
    javascript' through a plugin to deploy the possibilities, but it
    would (and should) be a lot easier if a could just setup a
    javascript object." You want JavaScript to be unrestrictedly
    allowed to open socket connections? Ahahaha. No.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you strip out all of those, then you're left with barely anything.
More importantly, there's nothing actually <em>good</em> left in the list; it's
all little incremental improvements. Is Firefox really so good that
no-one can think of anything it might do differently? It's the perfect
execution of the web browser concept? It surely isn't. I intend to lay
out a few thoughts on what I'd like to see happen in a future post, but
for now I'll just say: can't we do better than this? To be honest, I'm
being unfair. There are some good suggestions in the list. What
disappoints me is the lack of decent solutions, the lack of vision. Most
of the ones that are in my "it already exists" category above (and there
are <em>many</em> that I didn't highlight; the above is just a selection) are
things where I happen to know that it exists but I can understand that
users do not. I need to go through the Firefox list and update it with
some of these complaints or pointers to existing implementation, so that
people can know. The moronic suggestions, by contrast, tend to be things
that fall foul of Raymond Chen's "what would happen if it actually did
this?" thought experiment.</p>
