			<p>I'm starting to get really hacked off with Google Reader. I've
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/10/11/looking-at-rawdog">mentioned this already</a>, but I thought I might fill in a few more
reasons. You might be thinking: why haven't these been submitted as bugs
to the Reader team? Well, most of them aren't really susceptible to
that. I'll come back to this point later. The old version kept dying all
the time: it popped up a "loading" screen and it never went away. Forced
refresh sometimes brought it back, and sometimes didn't. When the
all-new exciting version came out I thought that this problem might be
fixed: in fact, it's actually got worse. I find Reader hangs probably
once every three or four times I use it. <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/10/10/ajax-loading-screens">There's no point in doing Ajax things if you have to wait 20 seconds for it to load</a>. I've already
ranted about this, though. As far as I can tell, you can no longer skip
to the next item by pressing space. Maybe this works for everyone else,
because it ties into... If you have All Items shown, and some new items
have arrived since you clicked it, I can't find a way to refresh the
list of All Items. I have to switch to Home and then switch <em>back</em> to
All Items again, with two long waits with a loading screen. Apparently
"r" is meant to refresh, but that doesn't do anything. I've tried "r"
and alt+r and neither seem to help. It gets confused about whether
articles have unread items or not. See here: <img alt="The left hand pane shows Python News with a (1) for one unread item, the header shows" src="http://www.kryogenix.org/random/goog.png"> I <em>could
not</em> get Reader to show me this mysterious unread item, or to
acknowledge that it wasn't there. I tried a full refresh (just loading
Reader again), I tried switching to Home, back to All Items, I tried
showing the feed individually (which is what the screenshot shows). This
also happened with other feeds; the only way I could get the supposed
new items alert (the "1 new items" and the (1) in the left pane) to go
away was to "View all items" (all of which appeared to be read) and then
say "Mark all read". Now, though, I'm left with the lingering suspicion
that there really <em>was</em> an unread item and now I won't ever get to read
it. (Plus: 1 new items? Hm.) In terms of filing bugs: what should I do
about that last one? I have no idea how to replicate it, I can't give
instructions. I could say "look at my Reader page and you'll see it",
but then I basically can't use Reader until I get an acknowledgement
that the Reader team have diagnosed the problem, which I don't want to
do. Anyway, as soon as I've got my customisations done to Rawdog, I'm
switching. Sorry, Google team. I have to say that Gmail is increasingly
getting confused and having to be full-refreshed or just hanging on the
"Sending..." bit when trying to send a mail (it's still an Ajax loading
screen, even if it's just in the top right hand corner). Makes me sad.
If Google can't make this stuff work, who can? Maybe I should look
harder at the Yahoo stuff instead? They seem to be coming on strong
recently.</p>
