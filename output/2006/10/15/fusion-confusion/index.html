			<p>Leaving university, moving from being a loafing and lazy student to
being a paid-up besuited member of the rat race, means a pretty
significant change to life. You stop being funded by the government for
a start, unless you decide to throw away your soul (what the hell, you
weren't using it anyway) and go and work for the civil service. (Nurses
and doctors and so on are excluded here; NHS consultants are not.) You
start getting up at seven and going to bed at eleven, rather than
getting up at eleven and going to sleep when the cigarettes run out, or
possibly slumped against a wall in a nightclub. You stop caring about
politics, until you start caring about it again. The amount you actually
contribute to society starts an upward turn, just as your beer
consumption and the amount you want to contribute to society and the
amount you give a shit about contributing to society start their
horrific screaming nosedive toward ground zero. And you have to buy your
own shower gel for the first time in twenty-one years. None of this,
though, has as much of an effect as the most important paradigm shift
between the two states. You stop eating takeaways. When I was at
university, we ate pizza all the time. Babylon Pizza (that's 0191 386
4004 for those of you following along in Durham, assuming the number
hasn't changed in the last decade, which <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/vm.jcr/i/takeaway/pizzaking.jpg?PHPSESSID=aa17766db2b17072f372122b55bbd70e">I'm gratified to see that it hasn't, although it has changed its name to Pizza King</a> (beware: large
jpg! also crimes against typography!)) got so many orders from us that
all I had to do was dial the number and say "Hello" to get a 10"
olives-mushroom-sweetcorn and a 12" chicken-ham-pepperoni delivered to
our house. (This is really true.) I'm beaten in this only by my aunt
Caroline, who once got a letter from BT saying that she could save money
by picking the listed ten numbers as her Friends and Family (a scheme
from British Telecom, the UK phone company, designed to offer a discount
on the numbers you ring most often); number four on the list was the
Chinese takeaway. Caroline, a grown-up, had reached that pitch of adult
life when you get to eat food that you didn't cook (and microwaving
counts here) on a semi-regular basis. It took us a while to get there,
but we're there now; in fact, because we're so rich and so posh and so
uncaring, we've blown right through the wall of takeaways and into
actually <em>going out</em> for dinners. Those of you in London (or, I imagine,
New York or Boston or Sydney or probably Moscow for all I know) will now
be sneering into your mochacockachocochinos before instructing your
secretaries to book your usual lunch table at Wagamamas like Patrick
Bateman, I know. However, out here in the provinces, eating out is still
an interesting and vibrant experience rather than just what you do in
between 12.30 and 3pm. So we went out for dinner, as we do quite often
these days. Eating out is problematic if you have a youngish child; my
daughter, Niamh, is six. Now, she's approximately the best behaved child
in the universe, so just going out to a normal restaurant, sitting,
eating, and talking, isn't a problem. She won't get restless, she won't
cause a scene. She will, however, get bored, and I think it's pretty
important that everyone enjoys going out. So we normally end up going to
a pub with a children's play area, so Sam and I can eat dinner while
Niamh jumps and runs about on some insane enormous room-filling
contraption made out of Meccano and covered with foam and occasionally
runs out to gulp down some spaghetti bolognaise. Last night was a
change: we were going for a Chinese meal. Now, I like Chinese. Sam's
more a curry person, so we argue a lot about that on takeaway days and
normally settle on pizzas, but last night was for Chinese. You may have
noticed the increasing trend in the UK (if you're in the UK) for Chinese
restaurants to move over to "buffet-style" dining, where they cook a
mountain of different sorts of food and you can eat as much of whatever
you want for a fixed price. I, personally, think that this is a good
idea on a par with fire, indoor plumbing, and uncapped internet
connections, because when I have Chinese I only ever eat sweet-and-sour
chicken with egg fried rice. Not for me Beef with Green Peppers in Black
Bean Sauce! You can keep your King Prawns with Ginger and Spring Onions
Szechuan style! Sweet and sour chicken, that's where it's at. Lemon
chicken on a good day. Unadventurous, true, but if you want to eat
interesting new things go to someone else's house. Anyway, the buffet
concept allows me to eat two or three plates of that and then stagger
home barely able to breathe, which is clearly the point of going out for
dinner. The restaurant in town is a buffet-style place, so we had it
earmarked; we've been meaning to go there for five years, so this was a
momentous occasion. And when we got there it was closed for
refurbishment. That's poor customer service, that. Admittedly we've only
been <em>talking</em> about going to the place for half a decade rather than
actually venturing across the threshold and proffering money in exchange
for food, but that's not the point! Where's our dinner? So we headed
onward. Sam had had recommendations for somewhere called <a href="http://www.mybrum.co.uk/birmingham/restaurants-review-shanghai-fusion.htm">Shanghai
Fusion</a>, on Salop Street in Dudley. Out to Dudley headed the three
brave explorers. Now, we didn't know where Salop Street was, but we
intended to try the time-honoured "drive around until you find it"
location technique, what with Dudley not being all that big. Turns out
it's big enough to defeat us, though, and after my griping about how
<em>my</em> car has sat-nav (we were in Sam's) reached enough of a pitch, my
lovely wife pointed out that I constantly boast about (and consequently
have to pay for) my phone having a net connection; couldn't I just go
and <em>get</em> a map? Well, I have the <a href="http://www.mgmaps.com/">Mobile GMaps</a> Java app on my phone
for just such an eventuality, so I fired it up. I'd <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/05/10/phone">looked at it
before</a>, at which point I was a bit over-effusive about the
wonderfulness of being able to see a map on your phone ("the Google Maps
viewer is the coolest thing in the whole fucking world. I am not
kidding. It does UK maps as well. Wow. Just, wow. I will never, ever be
lost again"). That falls dramatically into the category of "Famous Last
Words". Actually trying to use it taught me two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's really, really, really slow. Phones are such a crappy platform
    for accessing the net. Perhaps 3G is fast enough, but as far as I
    can tell you can't tell your phone "use a 3G connection to just
    connect to the net". You can use it for pointless video calls or
    downloading trailers to movies you don't want to watch, but you
    can't make the Java apps on your phone like Mobile GMaps or Opera
    Mini use a 3G connection instead of a GPRS one. The slowness was
    agonising. "OK, I can now see Dudley on the map; I'll zoom in. Drive
    around the block again a couple of times while the three map tiles
    load." That, however, was enormously exacerbated by</li>
<li>It forgets map tiles and sets them back to blank and then reloads
    them. While you're looking at them. What you really want when you're
    trying to navigate through town with directions like "Well, keep
    going up this street; I can't tell you which side-street to take
    because the map isn't zoomed enough for that because I don't want to
    wait another ten minutes" is for the bloody map you're looking at to
    bloody disappear and then reappear again three minutes later when it
    reloads. Why in the name of Jesus on a one-wheeled bicycle would
    that ever, ever, ever be a good idea? Don't do that. Just...don't.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually, <em>eventually</em>, we got there. After some more fun and games
parking, we entered the restaurant. And actually, it wasn't too bad. The
reason it's called Shanghai Fusion is because it's not only a Chinese
buffet restaurant; it's an Indian buffet restaurant as well. So you can
have chicken tikka with egg fried rice. Beef with cashew nuts <em>and</em>
mango chutney. Lamb balti with sweet-and-sour sauce on and a poppadom.
Personally, I thought that was weird, and eating it didn't change my
opinion, but I can't complain about the quality of the cooking. My
approach rapidly became "pretend you've just come out for a Chinese and
ignore all the Indian stuff", because the culture clash did my head in,
but all around me people were eating beansprouts with mint yoghurt
dressing with evidence of genuine enjoyment. I have to say the place is
recommended, even if they apparently don't take credit cards and I had
to take a break between plates of sweet-and-sour to go out and get some
money from a nearby garage. On the way out, Niamh said "I know why it's
called Fusion. It must be called <em>Fusion</em> because it's <em>confusing</em> to
get there." All this leads me, as ever, to two conclusions. Firstly, you
should eat out more. It gives you the chance to enjoy great food and not
have to wash up afterwards, and it's really not that expensive. Shanghai
Fusion was a tenner a head, which is not bad considering you can eat a
hundredweight of chicken tikka <em>and</em> there was carrot cake and gateau
and ice cream for dessert <strong>and</strong> you could smoke too. And secondly,
when you do decide to go out, take a map. INSERT_MAP INSERT_ADDRESS</p>
