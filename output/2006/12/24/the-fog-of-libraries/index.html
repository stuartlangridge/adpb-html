		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>It&#8217;s pretty foggy at the moment, here in the Midlands in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. It&#8217;s
been like it for two days. Stepping out of work the other day, after
dark, with each street light at the centre of a glowing aura, made the
street I work on — in the centre of Birmingham — look like something
Victorian. Like a woodcut from a Sherlock Holmes book. I wouldn&#8217;t have
been at all surprised to see a hansom cab pull up and a man with a
sword-stick get out. Of course, I wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised to see
Jack the Ripper hiding in a doorway either. It made it feel like it was
nearly Christmas, which it is. It was really rather difficult to
remember that it&#8217;s still the same old modern street underneath. So now
I&#8217;m going to talk about JavaScript libraries. You&#8217;ll see how the fog is
relevant in a bit. There&#8217;s been quite a bit of discussion of libraries
recently. <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/92">Jeremy Keith writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot of talk about JavaScript libraries, including a lot of
hype and cheerleading, but I think that maybe the discussion is
disproportionate to the amount of people actually using libraries.
Personally, I’m somewhat mistrustful of using other people’s code (I’m
a bit of a control freak) and I thought I was in the minority, but
having spoken to people like Stuart and <span class="caps">PPK</span> who share my feelings, now
I’m not so&nbsp;sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/elsewhere/archives/2006/12/"><span class="caps">PPK</span> himself says</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a quick and non-scientific poll @media showed that only a minority of
JavaScript developers use a library; the others just code by hand. But
JavaScript libraries are cool nowadays and will remain so until the
Ajax hype blows&nbsp;over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/index.php?p=366">Chris Heilmann complains mightily about libraries in general</a>,
although about specific details rather than about the concept of using
libraries as a whole. And <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/six_things_that_suck_about_the_web_in_2006/">Roger lays into people who use them</a>,&nbsp;too:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overuse of JavaScript frameworks/libraries. Back to the 90’s, baby,
except they were called <span class="caps">DHTML</span> libraries that time around. What is it
with people learning a JavaScript library instead of learning to write
JavaScript? It’s like learning Frontpage instead of <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Yes, script
libraries can be great. But not when people use them because they can
instead of because they&nbsp;should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of people are getting into the whole idea of using a <span class="caps">JS</span> library.
Among the cognoscenti, though, there&#8217;s starting to be a bit of a
backlash. &#8220;Putting guns in the hands of children&#8221; is how the discussion
was phrased during our <span class="caps">JS</span> panel at @media 2006. The idea behind this
discussion is that libraries give developers access to lots of cool
powerful stuff &#8212; hiding and showing areas of the page, Ajax requests,
animation &#8212; without them having to really demonstrate that they know
what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s an argument with a certain amount of truth in
it; it&#8217;s used a lot by gun-control advocates as well, because if you
have to go through five years of training to become a karate black belt
then you&#8217;re much less likely to kill someone after leaving the pub, and
much less likely to accidentally kill a member of your family, than
someone who&#8217;s bought a Saturday night special and hasn&#8217;t had any
training. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a pretty elitist viewpoint.
Apparently, you shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to use JavaScript unless you&#8217;re an
expert. New developers, people just looking to get their job done,
someone who wants to apply a cool effect: these people are not wanted in
our glorious new revolution. Dammit, programming ought to be hard: it
keeps out the idiots. This attitude comes up a lot, a <em>lot</em>, in the
Linux world, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why Linux is perceived as being
harder to use than, say, a Mac: I&#8217;m surprised that there are Mac people
out there who are highly happy<span title="dare I say smug?">*</span>
with the ease of use of their computers and don&#8217;t have to understand one
iota about how they work under the covers, but still believe that
JavaScript developers should be held to a higher standard. What drives
adoption of technology is real ordinary people, people who come in at
9am and clock off at 5pm and don&#8217;t think about work outside those hours,
being able to use those technologies. JavaScript libraries bridge that
gap. I&#8217;ve changed my opinions on this quite a bit; I used to hand-code
all my JavaScript myself, and now, for quite a few of my projects, I use
jQuery. I just got sick and tired of thinking: how do I hook up events
in <span class="caps">IE5</span>.5? Is it different to 6.0? Where&#8217;s that cut-and-pasted code for
creating and using an XMLHttpRequest object in every browser? I&#8217;d ended
up building a tiny library for myself of bits of code I cut-and-pasted
into every project, and my library was inferior to others because I
don&#8217;t do as much testing in every browser. So, why not use a library? I
couldn&#8217;t think of a reason. Now cross-browser testing is John Resig&#8217;s
problem, which is handy. The fog hid the nastiness of Birmingham.
Libraries hide the nastiness of cross-browser scripting. While it&#8217;s easy
to say that you should have to know about the nastiness, this is the
season of goodwill. It&#8217;s <em>nice</em> to step out of your office into a foggy
lit street that looks like a scene from <em>It&#8217;s A Wonderful Life</em>. Let&#8217;s
not take that away from people. This doesn&#8217;t answer <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/index.php?p=366">Chris Heilmann&#8217;s
objections</a>, though, and that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re a damned good set of
objections. The libraries we have are in general not well documented; a
list of functions that the <span class="caps">API</span> provides <em>does not help</em> if you know what
you want to do but not how to do it, because you have to guess at what
the library might have named this function. Making the documentation
available only online doesn&#8217;t help either, although this is something
that really could be fixed by someone other than the main library
developers &#8212; most documentation issues, including a proper decent set
of examples of how your library can progressively enhance a page, with a
case study or two, can be fixed by people outside the core team. So if
you really hate this issue, jump in and get involved by building some
docs for the library you like the most. None of these problems are
insoluble, though. Part of the issue is that JavaScript developers
divide&nbsp;into:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who aren&#8217;t hugely experienced with <span class="caps">JS</span>; these are at least
    some of the target market for a lot of&nbsp;libraries</li>
<li>People who are experienced and are writing a&nbsp;library</li>
<li>People who are experienced and think that you shouldn&#8217;t use
    libraries unless you have the experience to not use&nbsp;them</li>
<li>People who are experienced and willing to&nbsp;help</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, category 1 people aren&#8217;t going to help write documentation
very much, or case studies, or browser support matrices, because they&#8217;re
consumers of that information rather than creators. (Those of you who
think &#8220;yes! we&#8217;ll have a huge army of people contributing!&#8221;, take a tip
from the Linux world, where we&#8217;ve been using that model for code since
the beginning; it happens, but not all that often.) Category 2 people
are too busy writing a library to build supporting stuff around it. Too
many of the remaining: people who could be helping to make the libraries
we have better, and better documented, and more appropriate, and less
stuffed to the gills with flashy but bad effects, are too busy
repudiating the entire concept of libraries. They&#8217;re in category 3. If
we can collectively, as a community, move from category 3 to category 4,
and make the libraries we have great, then there won&#8217;t need to be any
kind of objection to them. Let&#8217;s try and&nbsp;help.</p>
