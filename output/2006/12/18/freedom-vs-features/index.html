			<p><em>This entry is my opinion and certainly doesn&#8217;t represent the views of
my employer, who couldn&#8217;t care less about software freedom.</em> I&#8217;ve been
in lots of discussions about software freedom. I&#8217;ve been loud-mouthed
about it at my <a href="http://www.wolveslug.org.uk/">Linux User Group</a>, I&#8217;ve been loud-mouthed about it on
<a href="http://www.lugradio.org/">LugRadio</a>, I&#8217;ve posted about it here. I&#8217;ve also recently expressed
the view that <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/12/13/free-ubuntu">Ubuntu might not be quite free enough for me</a>. I
suspect it might be time to try and lay out my viewpoint in a bit more
detail. My viewpoint boils down to: all software should be free. You
might agree with that, you might not. This has come up most sharply
recently with the much-announced Ubuntu decision to attempt to compete
with proprietary alternatives like Windows Vista and Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X by
enabling a better graphical interface if you have proprietary video
drivers. I don&#8217;t agree with that shift, and my view on that point has
been challenged as being inconsistent, a block on the future success of
Linux, and just plain wrong. One of the phrases I&#8217;ve used in the past,
particularly on LugRadio, is &#8220;no compromise&#8221;. I&#8217;ve said repeatedly that
we shouldn&#8217;t give up on freedom to get features, that we shouldn&#8217;t be
prepared to embrace proprietary, closed-off software even if that
rejection comes at some cost. And I&#8217;ve said all this while working for a
firm who use Windows everywhere and happily taking money off them in my
paycheque every month. How is this reasonable? Let&#8217;s look at an analogy.
I smoke. Have done for years. I also have a six year old daughter. Now,
if my daughter asked me if she should smoke, what should I say? Some
people would say that I have no right to stand there with a cigarette in
my hand and tell her not to do it. Others would be fine with the idea of
me advising her against. Very few people would suggest that I should
encourage her to do so. If I, then, told her that she shouldn&#8217;t smoke,
and that it would be bad for her, would that make me part of the
holier-than-thou hypocrite brigade? Should she ignore my advice on that
basis? Should she ignore any other advice that I give her, like not
sticking her fingers in electric sockets, because I&#8217;m a holier-than-thou
blogger who doesn&#8217;t practice what he preaches? When I was a kid I got
told that two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right. Myself smoking and her not is a
better goal, overall, than myself smoking and her smoking too.
Obviously, a better end still would be neither of us doing so. However,
it would be better to at least start by making her Free of the bad
thing, even if I haven&#8217;t managed it yet. That someone suggests an idea
but doesn&#8217;t do it themselves doesn&#8217;t make the idea a bad idea. That I
smoke doesn&#8217;t make my advice to people to not smoke be worthless. Back
away from the analogy again, although I imagine you can see how it&#8217;s
related to the topic. That I want to hold people to a standard of
Freedom that I haven&#8217;t yet achieved myself isn&#8217;t a fault with the idea
of being free. It&#8217;s a fault with me, that I haven&#8217;t got that far yet. If
you&#8217;d like to help, I&#8217;d be interested in your input on <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/12/13/free-ubuntu">how I might make
Ubuntu free enough for my needs</a>. If you&#8217;re using Linux, right now, it&#8217;s a reasonable assumption
that software freedom means something to you. There are people, plenty
of them, out there who are using it purely because they like it or
because it&#8217;s the best technical solution for them, but a high proportion
of the Linux userbase are part of that userbase at least partially for
ethical, as well as technical or financial, reasons. If that&#8217;s the case,
ask yourself: would you be happy to see Linux have a 50% market share
but have the principles of free software, of being able to hack on it
all, be partially <em>compromised</em> (there&#8217;s that word again) to get that
far? Some of the nature of Free software is difficult to choke down at
times; that someone can take your work and sell it and not give you any
of the money, for example. Or that someone else could take your code and
change a few bits and make something better, and get most of the credit.
That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about, though; that&#8217;s what the Debian Free Software
Guidelines, and the Open Source Definition, and the Free Software
Foundation, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re all talking about. If you believe in
that, if you want to be in a position where not only can someone sell
your work or improve on it, but also where you can sell someone else&#8217;s,
or where you can improve on another person&#8217;s program, you have to
support Freedom. If you really wouldn&#8217;t mind if your next Linux
distribution (or the one after, or the one after that) was only, say,
60% hackable, because the rest of it is proprietary &#8212; <em>so we can keep
up with the competition</em>, of course, or <em>because we need that hardware</em>
&#8212; then you should have no qualms about the decision at all, and good
luck to you. You&#8217;re welcome to feel that way. If you don&#8217;t like that
idea, though, perhaps you take offence at being lumped into a
<em>holier-than-thou zealot</em> category. A phrase you&#8217;ll hear, sometimes, is
<em>the end justifies the means</em>. Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn&#8217;t; you
can think of arguments for each side relatively easily, I suspect. Ask
yourself, though, what happens if you decide to step away from your
principles for a while and then find yourself unable to get back to them
later. It&#8217;s not a pleasant situation to be in, to hold something dear to
your heart and find yourself unable to achieve it because of some bad
choices you made in the past. Making those wrong choices might make it
impossible to ever get to your goals. Some doors can only be closed
once. It&#8217;s difficult to know ahead of time whether the choices we&#8217;re
making are of that type, but you owe it to yourself to consider the
possibility. Make your views felt; be rational and reasonable about it,
and clearly outline what might happen, so you can&#8217;t be dismissed as a
zealot or shouted down by people who don&#8217;t realise the seriousness of
what they&#8217;re contemplating. But be part of the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
