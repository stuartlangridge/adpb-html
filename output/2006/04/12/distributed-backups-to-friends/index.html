		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>It ought to be possible to have a backup system with the following
characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>You download a backup client and run it. It asks for a backup group
    name and a password. It is cross-platform, or at least ported to
    Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It also asks how much space you're
    prepared to devote to backups.</li>
<li>You choose directories and files to back up by finding them in your
    file manager and tagging them as "For backup".</li>
<li>That's then all the user interaction that there is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The way the backup actually <em>works</em> is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes the stuff you want to back up, and creates a big backup
    file out of it, every night.</li>
<li>It breaks the file up into bits, using the PAR stuff from
    <a href="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/">parchive.sourceforge.net</a>. This means that to recover your
    backup, you need some <em>but not all</em> of the bits, so if some bits get
    lost it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>It then ships the bits out to other people in your backup group and
    stores it on their systems, not on yours, giving you off-site
    backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would make it very easy for a group of people to do mutual backups
without having to think very hard about it.  </p>
<h3>Implementation thoughts</h3>
<p>You'd need a server somewhere, to store password details for backup
groups and to co-ordinate shipping the data around (since everyone's
likely to be behind a firewall). No-one should ever see or know about
this server, though. There is no "sign-up procedure"; to create a new
backup group, you just run the client and provide a backup group name
and password. That's all. You don't have to sign up on the web or
explicitly invite anyone into the group; anyone with the username and
password can join. There's nothing in the above about how to restore
from a backup, I know. That needs some kind of UI, but I'm not sure what
that should be. It needs to warn you if there's not enough space out
there on the group to back up all the stuff you're trying to back up.
Some kind of algorithm which demands that if you want to back up N
megabytes you have to offer 3N megabytes of space to the group or
something. There should be some rsyncness in it. If not much has
changed, it shouldn't need to send much out to the group. However, this
might be complex, because the previous backup is in scattered bits, and
you don't want to do incremental backups because then you need the full
backup as well. Backups must be encrypted, because they're stored on
someone else's machine. There will probably need to be some kind of UI
to provide a passphrase or similar. This also makes rsyncness difficult.
I think this would be a really useful project. The key point, the
absolutely critical point, is that the client must be as described
above: it just asks you which backup group you're in and <strong>that's all</strong>.
No ten pages of options, no need for you to tell it who else is in the
group or to maintain a list of who that is or where you want backups to
go. If it's in any way difficult, it won't get used, and then no-one has
backups. Wish I had time to write this. The big problem that needs
solving is how to have the rsyncness in it, so that it only ships
changes around rather than a full backup every night. Other than that,
it's all doable, and not all that difficult.</p>
