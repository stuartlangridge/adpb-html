		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>It ought to be possible to have a backup system with the following&nbsp;characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>You download a backup client and run it. It asks for a backup group
    name and a password. It is cross-platform, or at least ported to
    Linux, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X, and Windows. It also asks how much space you&#8217;re
    prepared to devote to&nbsp;backups.</li>
<li>You choose directories and files to back up by finding them in your
    file manager and tagging them as &#8220;For&nbsp;backup&#8221;.</li>
<li>That&#8217;s then all the user interaction that there&nbsp;is.</li>
</ol>
<p>The way the backup actually <em>works</em> is&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes the stuff you want to back up, and creates a big backup
    file out of it, every&nbsp;night.</li>
<li>It breaks the file up into bits, using the <span class="caps">PAR</span> stuff from
    <a href="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/">parchive.sourceforge.net</a>. This means that to recover your
    backup, you need some <em>but not all</em> of the bits, so if some bits get
    lost it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter.</li>
<li>It then ships the bits out to other people in your backup group and
    stores it on their systems, not on yours, giving you off-site&nbsp;backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>That would make it very easy for a group of people to do mutual backups
without having to think very hard about&nbsp;it.  </p>
<h3>Implementation&nbsp;thoughts</h3>
<p>You&#8217;d need a server somewhere, to store password details for backup
groups and to co-ordinate shipping the data around (since everyone&#8217;s
likely to be behind a firewall). No-one should ever see or know about
this server, though. There is no &#8220;sign-up procedure&#8221;; to create a new
backup group, you just run the client and provide a backup group name
and password. That&#8217;s all. You don&#8217;t have to sign up on the web or
explicitly invite anyone into the group; anyone with the username and
password can join. There&#8217;s nothing in the above about how to restore
from a backup, I know. That needs some kind of <span class="caps">UI</span>, but I&#8217;m not sure what
that should be. It needs to warn you if there&#8217;s not enough space out
there on the group to back up all the stuff you&#8217;re trying to back up.
Some kind of algorithm which demands that if you want to back up N
megabytes you have to offer 3N megabytes of space to the group or
something. There should be some rsyncness in it. If not much has
changed, it shouldn&#8217;t need to send much out to the group. However, this
might be complex, because the previous backup is in scattered bits, and
you don&#8217;t want to do incremental backups because then you need the full
backup as well. Backups must be encrypted, because they&#8217;re stored on
someone else&#8217;s machine. There will probably need to be some kind of <span class="caps">UI</span>
to provide a passphrase or similar. This also makes rsyncness difficult.
I think this would be a really useful project. The key point, the
absolutely critical point, is that the client must be as described
above: it just asks you which backup group you&#8217;re in and <strong>that&#8217;s all</strong>.
No ten pages of options, no need for you to tell it who else is in the
group or to maintain a list of who that is or where you want backups to
go. If it&#8217;s in any way difficult, it won&#8217;t get used, and then no-one has
backups. Wish I had time to write this. The big problem that needs
solving is how to have the rsyncness in it, so that it only ships
changes around rather than a full backup every night. Other than that,
it&#8217;s all doable, and not all that&nbsp;difficult.</p>
