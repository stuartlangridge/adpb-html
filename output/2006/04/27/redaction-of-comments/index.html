		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I have a page wherein <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2005/02/25/warehouse">I ranted about Carphone Warehouse</a>. It
attracted lots and lots of comments, most of which were just randomly
obscene for the sake of it. Eventually, Carphone Warehouse themselves
contacted me and asked if I&#8217;d remove comments that they found offensive,
and I said I would. They sent me the following&nbsp;missive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I refer our discussion over the phone a week ago in regards to the
webpage of your website www.kryogenix.org which is/was about The
Carphone Warehouse (<span class="caps">CPW</span>). Please accept my apologies for the delay in
replying. As discussed, we believe that numerous comments posted on
this page are defamatory. These statements are not true and are not
supported by any facts. The fact that they are posted by alleged <span class="caps">CPW</span>
employees or former employees makes the matter even more dangerous,
and readers of these statements may believe that they are a true
reflection of <span class="caps">CPW</span>&#8217;s workplace, and more importantly, <span class="caps">CPW</span>&#8217;s work ethic.
We noted for instance comments implying that if your face does not fit
you cannot progress at <span class="caps">CPW</span>. Other statements implied that <span class="caps">CPW</span> was only
driven by money with no concern for its customers or employees. These
statements are intolerable and we would appreciate your willingness to
withdraw them from the webpage. The webpage contains 246 comments,
which are numerated. For convenience I will only refer to the numbers
appearing in front of each statement. For clarity, the statement
number one is the one that was posted on 25 February 2005 at 11.05am.
Please remove the following statements: 7/ 18/ 10/ 15/ 17/ 20/ 21/ 23/
25/ 26/ 35/ 36/ 37/ 41/ 107/ 121/ 130/ 134/ 151/ 153/ 156/ 157/ 158/
163/ 165/ 170/ 177/ 178/ 179/ 183/ 184/ 188/ 198/ 209/ 213.
Furthermore, we have also noted statements that were insulting and
degrading. It is totally unacceptable that our employees&#8217; names are
disclosed in the comments. We therefore, demand that you remove these
statements as well: 13/ 18/ 28/ 29/ 31/ 38/ 120/ 161/ 162/ 166/ 185/
186/ 187/ 217/ 219/ 222/ 232/ 235. As explained on the phone, we
accept that people are entitled to express their views about <span class="caps">CPW</span>.
However, there are limits to this freedom. Certain comments are
extremely insulting and degrading and have caused shock amongst some
of our employees. We would prefer to see the entire webpage closed. I
am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your help in
this&nbsp;matter.
</p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve redacted practically all the comments on the page. On the one hand,
there is the voice in my head telling me that I should fight the power
and that this is an abrogation of free speech. On the other hand, I just
<em>don&#8217;t care enough</em> to be bothered about defending a group of people who
are clearly just looking for a place to vent. A brief history: I closed
off comments on the post some time back, after it got up to 250
comments. Someone emailed me and <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/02/06/party-hearty#comment-5398">left a comment on another post</a>
asking me to open it back up so conversation there could continue,
because it &#8220;was helping a lot of people&#8221;. I took, and still take, the
view that this site is mine, and I run it for my benefit; it&#8217;s not here
to provide people with a general discussion forum. There&#8217;s other
examples of that here too; I&#8217;ve closed off commenting on <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/07/23/interactive">a post I made being amused about Schroedinger&#8217;s Cat</a> because it became a discussion
forum for people whose cats had died, and on my <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2003/02/12/famous">how to be rich and famous</a> post after it became a place for people to post their phone
numbers looking for talent agents. So, I said that if the Carphone
Warehouse employees set themselves up another place to talk about this,
I would add a comment directing people to that new place, which seemed
to me to be a reasonable compromise. They did so, and I did so. However,
I just checked that forum, and it no longer exists. I believe that you
should fight the power. This has been something of an ethical dilemma
for me, primarily because, well, <a href="http://www.telisphere.com/~cearley/sean/camps/first.html">first they came for the people who complained about Carphone Warehouse and I did not speak out because I did not complain about Carphone Warehouse</a>. I don&#8217;t mind holding the
torch and standing up for my beliefs. I think, though, that my desire to
do ethical good ends where I&#8217;d be maintaining a fight on behalf of a
bunch of people who are clearly not interested in doing it themselves
(they created some other forum and let it lapse) and fighting for a
position (whether <span class="caps">CPW</span> are a good firm internally) about which I have
neither information nor interest. Have I caved in to the Man? Should I
have done things differently? Answers in comments, because I <em>have</em>
comments on all my posts until they prove to be a liability.
Incidentally, my emailed response to them&nbsp;said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve removed most of the comments on that page, including all that you
specified. I&#8217;m a little concerned, though: we seemed to have a
reasonable conversation, in which you made a request to which I
agreed, and now I receive an email containing phrases like &#8220;we
therefore, demand that you remove these statements&#8221;. Do you not feel
that using heavy-handed legal terminology and making demands of people
who have already agreed to help you will be counter-productive? It
certainly made me consider going back on our agreement because you did
not feel you could be gentlemanly about&nbsp;it.</p>
