			<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/05/30/bye-apple">Mark Pilgrim switches to Linux</a>, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">fills in a bit more about his decision</a>. I've got a lot of respect for Mark. He wrote the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://feedvalidator.org/">RSS and
Atom feed validator</a> (along with Sam Ruby, another Ubuntu user) and
<a href="http://www.feedparser.org/">Universal Feed Parser</a>, as well as <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/">Dive Into Greasemonkey</a> and
<a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive Into Python</a>, two freely-available online books, and <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/writings/tech/detail">I wrote four years ago about him being a clever chap</a>, but the most relevant
thing he's written to this decision is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Freedom 0</a>. That essay was
about his move from Movable Type to WordPress, which came about because
MT isn't free and WP is. Those of us who use Free Software (and Mark's
always been one, even given his previous choice of the proprietary Mac
OS X) have said, rather a lot, that proprietary lock-in creates problems
and stops you doing what you want with your data; Mark's now said that
he's experienced exactly that problem with OS X, just as he did with
Movable Type, and it's prompted a move to Ubuntu. Mark's a high-profile
weblogger in certain sections of the community, and hopefully this will
cause a few other people to question their choices. Interestingly, one
of the things that makes me cringe about the free software community is
the fanboy tendency; when someone in some way questions the
appropriateness of Linux for a task, fanboys pile on with flame upon
flame, and I hate that. It makes us all look bad, and it actively
discourages people who are on the fence from coming over to our side.
Well, it looks like the Mac community has similar fanboys for OS X,
looking at the comments on Mark's posts. I suspect that the Mac users I
know would cringe just as much, but it's nice to know (in a
<em>Schadenfreude</em> sort of way) that the epithet "zealot" can't <em>only</em> be
levelled at the free software people. Update: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges">interesting response from John Gruber</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/16/juggling-oranges">followup from Mark</a>. John's points are mostly well
taken: in particular,  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stories like that (ed: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060605081800/http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/06/14/snub/">Tom Yager getting a kicking from Apple for
writing that Apple have closed the x86 Darwin kernel, because Apple
say that no-one cares about that</a>) give rise to the sinking feeling
that Apple’s executives aren’t merely indifferent to openness, but
rather that their stance on openness is in fact highly calculated, and
that the calculation is that Apple should be open only so far as
necessary to be perceived as being open. I.e. that openness only
pertains to marketing, and not to engineering. There’s no question
that Apple is chock-a-block with engineers and engineering managers
who care about openness, but that does little good without a mandate
from the executive level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an argument we've made on LugRadio before now; it's interesting
that Gruber also thinks that it has some truth in it.</p>
