		<div class="entry-content e-content">
			<p>I got two pings yesterday from people curious about my IM away message,
which said "At Microsoft". That's because I was at Microsoft. The
Lugradio team were invited down to MS to talk to Nick McGrath, head of
platform strategy for Microsoft UK, and a cast of thousands about open
source software and how MS can engage with the community. It
went...interestingly. We went on a tour of the building, which affirmed
my belief that (if you don't mind the ethical issue) Microsoft must be a
great place to work; free drinks, decent chill-out area full of Xboxes
and pool tables, nice outdoor lake with free ice-cream, all that sort of
thing. Of course, you have to be OK with the idea of working for
Microsoft. That aside, though, they do treat their staff very well. We
also saw some demos of new-ish projects, like Vista and Office 12.
However, the interesting part (and one I wish had gone on longer) was
the discussion we had in the morning. They wanted to know more about how
MS are perceived by the community and outline some of the things they're
doing to enhance interoperability. We...kicked back pretty hard on that
point. The view that we put to them was that, for Microsoft,
interoperability means one of two things: either "partner agreements"
with specially anointed projects, or "we do what we like and you fit in
with us" (as <a href="http://www.tecspy.com/blogs/loveslugradio/2005/12/11#051211-episode4">Michael Erskine reminded us</a>, "there's no U in
interoperability"). the way to actual real proper interop is to open
your protocols; that way, <em>everyone</em> can interoperate with you without
you having to do any work. It means that I can choose Exchange as my
mail and calendaring server without therefore having to choose Outlook
(and therefore Windows) on the desktop. We hammered them pretty hard on
this point, and I think the message got through. One chap who was there,
Nick Barley (?), seemed to be pretty in-touch and in agreement. It was
all very informal; surprisingly so, I thought. This is obviously a good
thing, and as far as I could tell the fluffy clouds of niceness weren't
there to obscure barbed fish-hooks. They seemed genuine. Now, I
certainly wasn't expecting to go down there and convince Microsoft to
Free the Windows source code in four hours, and I don't know whether
what we said will actually have any effect, but it was interesting
nonetheless. I wish we'd had more time to continue the discussion,
though.</p>
