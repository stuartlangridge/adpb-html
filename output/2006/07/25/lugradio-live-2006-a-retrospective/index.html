			<p>LugRadio Live 2006 is over. Eight months of planning all for three days.
The happiness nosedive is massive after <span class="caps">LRL</span>; leaves me wanting to
organise another one next week just so I can make it all happen again.
It was wonderful. What a great weekend. A few things I ought to call out
as specifically&nbsp;superb:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Kat&#8217;s&nbsp;cakes</dt>
<dd>Kat made cakes for the evening party, which went down a storm.
<img alt="Many different types of cakes, in fact." src="http://static.flickr.com/66/196004958_34312fc44a_m.jpg"></dd>
<dt>Huw&nbsp;Lynes</dt>
<dd>Huw declared just before the big day that <a href="http://www.hlynes.com/2006/07/21/lugradio-live-pre-game/">Bruno Bord is a being of
unimaginable evil</a> to convince people to come to his talk instead.
Quality humour that man, although I ought to point out that that
trick <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=688">didn&#8217;t work when Jono tried it for Guadec</a>.</dd>
<dt>Pictures, pictures,&nbsp;pictures</dt>
<dd>Like all events and all things, we have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lugradio-live/pool/">a selection of photos on
Flickr</a>. Some of them are really cool, although none of the ones
with my lack of beard in&nbsp;them.</dd>
<dt>People i wanted to speak&nbsp;to</dt>
<dd>Once again, just like last year, hundreds of cool people flood
through the door and I only get to speak to a tiny fraction of them.
People this year who I particularly wanted to chat to for five
minutes and didn&#8217;t really get the chance because I was too busy:
Mike Hearn, Michael Meeks, Matt Zimmerman, Mark Shuttleworth, Drew
Mclellan and Rachel Andrew, Simon Willison, lex Hudson, Des Burley,
and plenty of others besides. I wish it could be a week&nbsp;long.</dd>
<dt>Talks I wanted to&nbsp;see</dt>
<dd>Similarly to people, there are talks. I never get to see any talks
at <span class="caps">LRL</span>, it seems. This year I saw four talks from beginning to end:
Bruno&#8217;s one about Lugradio; Mark Shuttleworth&#8217;s N Big Challenges,
Kat, Jen, and Phated&#8217;s one about women in open source; and LugRadio
Live and Unleashed, which hardly counts because that was us. I
caught the latter half of Mike Hearn&#8217;s, confirming my opinion that
what he&#8217;s describing is the right way to go about things even if
no-one listens. That was it. There were so many good things going
on. Perhaps too many, in fact, which leads me on&nbsp;to&#8230;</dd>
<dt>Things&nbsp;wrong</dt>
<dd>Lots of people have said: there were loads of times when stuff I
wanted to watch clashed. Now, that&#8217;s part and parcel of being at an
event; there are always going to be clashes. However, a couple of
people remarked that there were points when they wanted to go to the
main stage talk <em>and</em> both the lightning talks <em>and</em> a <span class="caps">BOF</span> all at
the same time. I&#8217;m not sure what we can do about this, since the
only two approaches I can think of are (a) make <span class="caps">LRL</span> longer, which is
problematic (it involves time off work then, and we&#8217;re not the sort
of event that your firm pays for you to attend) or (b) have less
stuff going on, which basically means making the weekend less good!
Suggestions on a postcard for that one. The air conditioning: yes,
yes, we know. We don&#8217;t have a lot of luck with air conditioning, it
seems. <span class="caps">BOF</span> points not in the main area: yep. That was sort of an
experiment, and we&#8217;ll know for next year; BOFs need to be in a
little enclosed area, like <span class="caps">BOF</span> Point 3 was this year. The exhibition
was a little out of the way. We didn&#8217;t think it was, really, but it
obviously was from the comments of our exhibitors. There are a few
ideas for how to fix that next year. Any other suggestions for
things that could have been improved will be gratefully&nbsp;accepted!</dd>
<dt>A community&nbsp;track?</dt>
<dd>I wonder next year whether we should have a special track for
speakers who are part of the LugRadio community. We&#8217;ve got a pretty
vibrant community; lots of you show up at <span class="caps">LRL</span>, and there are the
forums and so on; it might give us the chance to highlight people
who wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily get to speak at conferences. Something to
think about for next&nbsp;time.</dd>
<dt>No&nbsp;beard</dt>
<dd>I have no beard. After dotwaffle doubled his contribution to Amnesty
International, I shaved mine off as well as Jono doing his. This was
a sad moment in my life: <img alt="the beard departs" src="http://static.flickr.com/66/195656926_df220c9858_m.jpg"> I&#8217;m growing it back,
assuming I&#8217;m allowed. I look about 12 now. Christian Schaller and
Edward Hervey, who I now hate, reminded me of this not less than
once an hour from the time of shaving until the moment they left, so
I have decided that we should stop using gstreamer for Jokosher and
start using jack or something&nbsp;instead.</dd>
<dt>Jokosher <span class="caps">BOF</span></dt>
<dd>The Jokosher <span class="caps">BOF</span> was actually pretty productive. Summary notes are
<a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/jokosher-devel-list/2006-July/msg00135.html">on the mailing list</a>, and we know roughly where we&#8217;re going for
0.2, which is all cool. Plus we have <a href="https://wellsted.dyndns.org//gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4375&amp;g2_navId=x9e3d4210">photos of the dev team</a>, or
at least all those who were at <span class="caps">LRL</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In short, wow. I&#8217;d like to personally thank everyone who turned up for
making it the best community event around. See you next&nbsp;year.</p>
