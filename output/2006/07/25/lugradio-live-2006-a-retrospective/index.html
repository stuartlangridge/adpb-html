			<p>LugRadio Live 2006 is over. Eight months of planning all for three days.
The happiness nosedive is massive after LRL; leaves me wanting to
organise another one next week just so I can make it all happen again.
It was wonderful. What a great weekend. A few things I ought to call out
as specifically superb:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Kat's cakes</dt>
<dd>Kat made cakes for the evening party, which went down a storm.
<img alt="Many different types of cakes, in fact." src="http://static.flickr.com/66/196004958_34312fc44a_m.jpg"></dd>
<dt>Huw Lynes</dt>
<dd>Huw declared just before the big day that <a href="http://www.hlynes.com/2006/07/21/lugradio-live-pre-game/">Bruno Bord is a being of
unimaginable evil</a> to convince people to come to his talk instead.
Quality humour that man, although I ought to point out that that
trick <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=688">didn't work when Jono tried it for Guadec</a>.</dd>
<dt>Pictures, pictures, pictures</dt>
<dd>Like all events and all things, we have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lugradio-live/pool/">a selection of photos on
Flickr</a>. Some of them are really cool, although none of the ones
with my lack of beard in them.</dd>
<dt>People i wanted to speak to</dt>
<dd>Once again, just like last year, hundreds of cool people flood
through the door and I only get to speak to a tiny fraction of them.
People this year who I particularly wanted to chat to for five
minutes and didn't really get the chance because I was too busy:
Mike Hearn, Michael Meeks, Matt Zimmerman, Mark Shuttleworth, Drew
Mclellan and Rachel Andrew, Simon Willison, lex Hudson, Des Burley,
and plenty of others besides. I wish it could be a week long.</dd>
<dt>Talks I wanted to see</dt>
<dd>Similarly to people, there are talks. I never get to see any talks
at LRL, it seems. This year I saw four talks from beginning to end:
Bruno's one about Lugradio; Mark Shuttleworth's N Big Challenges,
Kat, Jen, and Phated's one about women in open source; and LugRadio
Live and Unleashed, which hardly counts because that was us. I
caught the latter half of Mike Hearn's, confirming my opinion that
what he's describing is the right way to go about things even if
no-one listens. That was it. There were so many good things going
on. Perhaps too many, in fact, which leads me on to...</dd>
<dt>Things wrong</dt>
<dd>Lots of people have said: there were loads of times when stuff I
wanted to watch clashed. Now, that's part and parcel of being at an
event; there are always going to be clashes. However, a couple of
people remarked that there were points when they wanted to go to the
main stage talk <em>and</em> both the lightning talks <em>and</em> a BOF all at
the same time. I'm not sure what we can do about this, since the
only two approaches I can think of are (a) make LRL longer, which is
problematic (it involves time off work then, and we're not the sort
of event that your firm pays for you to attend) or (b) have less
stuff going on, which basically means making the weekend less good!
Suggestions on a postcard for that one. The air conditioning: yes,
yes, we know. We don't have a lot of luck with air conditioning, it
seems. BOF points not in the main area: yep. That was sort of an
experiment, and we'll know for next year; BOFs need to be in a
little enclosed area, like BOF Point 3 was this year. The exhibition
was a little out of the way. We didn't think it was, really, but it
obviously was from the comments of our exhibitors. There are a few
ideas for how to fix that next year. Any other suggestions for
things that could have been improved will be gratefully accepted!</dd>
<dt>A community track?</dt>
<dd>I wonder next year whether we should have a special track for
speakers who are part of the LugRadio community. We've got a pretty
vibrant community; lots of you show up at LRL, and there are the
forums and so on; it might give us the chance to highlight people
who wouldn't ordinarily get to speak at conferences. Something to
think about for next time.</dd>
<dt>No beard</dt>
<dd>I have no beard. After dotwaffle doubled his contribution to Amnesty
International, I shaved mine off as well as Jono doing his. This was
a sad moment in my life: <img alt="the beard departs" src="http://static.flickr.com/66/195656926_df220c9858_m.jpg"> I'm growing it back,
assuming I'm allowed. I look about 12 now. Christian Schaller and
Edward Hervey, who I now hate, reminded me of this not less than
once an hour from the time of shaving until the moment they left, so
I have decided that we should stop using gstreamer for Jokosher and
start using jack or something instead.</dd>
<dt>Jokosher BOF</dt>
<dd>The Jokosher BOF was actually pretty productive. Summary notes are
<a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/jokosher-devel-list/2006-July/msg00135.html">on the mailing list</a>, and we know roughly where we're going for
0.2, which is all cool. Plus we have <a href="https://wellsted.dyndns.org//gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4375&amp;g2_navId=x9e3d4210">photos of the dev team</a>, or
at least all those who were at LRL.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In short, wow. I'd like to personally thank everyone who turned up for
making it the best community event around. See you next year.</p>
